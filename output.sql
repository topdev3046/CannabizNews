<p>Kaden Hartman of Virginia Beach is 13-years-old and lives with <a href="https://nnpdf.org/overview/" rel="nofollow">Niemann-Pick disease</a>, a condition known colloquially as Child&#8217;s Alzheimer&#8217;s. There are approximately 500 to 100 cases of diagnosed NPD today, making it extremely rare. Children with Niemann-Pick disease experience rapid physical and mental deterioration. Eventually, they&#8217;re faced with seizures and problems with mobility, eating, and communication. According to the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/story?id=4760023" rel="nofollow">National Niemann-Pick Disease Foundation</a>, most children suffering from Child&#8217;s Alzheimer&#8217;s don&#8217;t live to age 20. Kathy Hartman, the mother of this 13-year-old denied life-saving treatment because he used <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/cannabidiol-cbd/">CBD</a> oil, reached out to <em>High Times</em> to explain what happened.</p>
<h2>Kaden&#8217;s FDA-Approved Treatment</h2>
<p>&#8220;When there&#8217;s nothing else out there to save his life, the FDA will approve an experimental medicine, and he&#8217;s been on it for almost three years,&#8221; Mrs. Hartman explains.</p>
<p>The drug the FDA approved for Kaden is called Cyclodextrin and has been effectively treating Kaden&#8217;s Niemann-Pick disease.</p>
<p>Doctors predicted that Kaden wouldn&#8217;t live to age 13, but he&#8217;ll be 14 in April.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely working,&#8221; says Mrs. Hartman.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>The Benefits of CBD Oil</h2>
<div id="attachment_182272" style="max-width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-182272" src="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-1.jpeg" alt="13-Year-Old Denied Life-Saving Treatment Because He Used CBD Oil" width="1000" height="1294" srcset="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-1.jpeg 1000w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-1-77x100.jpeg 77w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-1-185x240.jpeg 185w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-1-768x994.jpeg 768w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-1-742x960.jpeg 742w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><p class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fa fa-camera"></i> Courtesy of Kathy Hartman</p></div>
<p>In addition to the experimental Cyclodextrin, Kaden has been taking CBD oil since he started experiencing <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/2-year-old-celebrates-seizure-free-using-hemp-oil/">seizures</a>, a common consequence of Niemann-Pick disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;It slows down seizures by, I think, 60 percent,&#8221; Mrs. Hartman says of CBD after doing research on the non-psychoactive compound of <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> on her own.</p>
<p>Watching her son experience 10 to 20 seizures daily, Mrs. Hartman decided to give CBD a shot, under the supervision of Kaden&#8217;s primary neurologist.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to be working great,&#8221; Mrs. Hartman told Kaden&#8217;s neurologist who closely monitored his CBD use.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>With CBD, Kaden avoided the negative side-effects associated with anti-seizure medication.</p>
<p>According to Kaden&#8217;s mother, the only potential results of CBD use are slight drowsiness and a better appetite.</p>
<p>Going off CBD, however, has had serious consequences.</p>
<p>After Mrs. Hartman received a letter from the Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center (VCU), the hospital treating Kaden, stating that Kaden will be taken off the study if he uses CBD, she stopped giving him the herbal supplements.</p>
<p>Off CBD, Kaden experiences many seizures. He has since fractured his skull, concussed himself, and developed two blood clots in his brain.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>Not only was this 13-year-old denied life-saving treatment because he used CBD oil, but CBD oil itself was a lifesaving treatment for seizures.</p>
<h2>Neurologists who work with&#160;Niemann-Pick disease patients recommend CBD Oil</h2>
<p>In addition to Kaden&#8217;s personal experience with CBD&#8217;s benefits, two of his neurologists recommended it.</p>
<p>His primary neurologist of 8 years suggested that Kaden take CBD to cope with his seizures.</p>
<p>Dr. Ralph Northam, Kaden&#8217;s former pediatrician who is now the governor of Virginia, wrote Kaden a prescription for cannabidiol.</p>
<p>Though Mrs. Hartman didn&#8217;t fill out this prescription at the time, it allowed Kaden access to CBD much more potent than the health store variety he later took.</p>
<p>Dr. Rebecca Caffrey, a friend of the Hartman family, explains, &#8220;CBD is the drug of choice for treating seizures in NPC kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>She cites another case of two young girls who suffer from Niemann-Pick disease and began taking CBD oil to minimize their seizures.</p>
<p>Not only did CBD help these girls&#8212;the daughters of Kathy Hartman&#8217;s friend Chris Hempel&#8212;but they are allowed to continue their other treatment, which is of the same nature as Kaden&#8217;s.</p>
<h2>Why the Hospital stopped Kaden&#8217;s Treatment</h2>
<div id="attachment_182273" style="max-width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-182273" src="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-2.jpeg" alt="13-Year-Old Denied Life-Saving Treatment Because He Used CBD Oil" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-2.jpeg 1000w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-2-100x67.jpeg 100w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-2-360x240.jpeg 360w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-2-768x511.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><p class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fa fa-camera"></i> Courtesy of Kathy Hartman</p></div>
<p>Four days after sending Mrs. Hartman that threatening letter, VCU gave her a call.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your son is on CBD oil. He is terminated from the clinical trial. Don&#8217;t bother ever showing up again,&#8221; Mrs. Hartman says, summing up her conversation.</p>
<p>Confused and infuriated, Mrs. Hartman reached out to VCU repeatedly, to no avail. However, Mrs. Hartman and Kaden showed up to his next appointments.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they tried to trick me,&#8221; Mrs. Hartman explains. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to break protocol with the FDA because now that would give them reason to terminate. So, I showed up for those [other appointments].&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Kaden attended his first two appointments after his trial was terminated, VCU canceled his critical spinal tap appointment held every other Monday.</p>
<p>To date, VCU has amended their statement, though this 13-year-old denied life-saving treatment because he used CBD Oil still cannot access Cyclodextrin.</p>
<p>VCU told Mrs. Hartman that they can get Kaden back on treatment once they have approval from the FDA, the International Review Board (IRB), and the pharmaceutical company.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartman says that they don&#8217;t need any of these approvals due to the nature of Kaden&#8217;s treatment and that they shouldn&#8217;t be sharing information with the pharmaceutical company in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;re giving his data to the pharmaceutical company without me agreeing to it, they have a major malpractice suit,&#8221; Mrs. Hartman clarifies.</p>
<p>But most importantly, the process of gaining all these unnecessary approvals could take months.</p>
<p>&#8220;The FDA only meets once a month. The IRB only meets maybe quarterly or once a month,&#8221; Mrs. Hartman worries.</p>
<p>To make matters more difficult, the company that manufactures Cyclodextrin has been bought out twice.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartman worries that &#8220;[Kaden] might never ever get back on this study.&#8221;</p>
<p>This could mean that this 13-year-old denied life-saving treatment because he used CBD oil may never again receive the medical care he needs.</p>
<h2>CBD doesn&#8217;t require FDA approval</h2>
<p>Not only do Kaden and others with NPD benefit from CBD, and experts recommend it across the board, but Kaden&#8217;s clinical trial never forbade CBD.</p>
<p>The FDA categorizes Kaden&#8217;s treatment as an IND: Individual New Drug Investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not part of a formal clinical trial. He&#8217;s a single patient under the compassionate use law,&#8221; Mrs. Hartman explains.</p>
<p>This means that Kaden&#8217;s treatment is more informal, and they don&#8217;t have to get FDA approval for CBD use.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Caffrey, &#8220;[Kaden] has received many meds not on the protocol, like steroids for the swelling in his fractured skull and pain meds during his recovery from that injury.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not only did doctors give Kaden medication without going through the FDA, but other patients with the same compassionate care drug trials for Niemann-Pick disease routinely take CBD.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartman believes, &#8220;All they have to do is write a two-paragraph letter to the FDA saying FYI we put him on this medicine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kaden&#8217;s doctor never even attempted to do so.</p>
<h2>Final Hit: 13-year-old denied life-saving treatment because he used CBD Oil</h2>
<p>The story of a 13-year-old denied life-saving treatment because he used CBD oil is tragic, unethical and, most likely, illegal.</p>
<p>Every moment that medical professional withholds the only treatment for Niemann-Pick disease, they are endangering Kaden&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>&#8220;First do no harm. By doing nothing, you&#8217;re creating harm,&#8221; as Mrs. Hartman told Dr. Syndi Seinfeld&#160;of VCU, who is responsible for halting Kaden&#8217;s treatment.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartman looks to the case of her friend Shanon&#8217;s son who missed two doses of cyclodextrin and died as a result.</p>
<p>Kaden missed his first dose on January 26<sup>th</sup> and has missed more since.</p>
<p>Confronted with the injustice of a medical community beholden to pharmaceutical companies and the ignorance of medical professionals, Mrs. Hartman told VCU, &#8220;You take him off the study&#8230;you just killed my child.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kentucky checks all the boxes for nourishing a hemp revival.</p>
<ul>
<li>Climate suited to the plant? Check.</li>
<li>Friendly regulations from a state willing to experiment and invest in hemp? Check.</li>
<li>Lots of cheap land and a processing infrastructure that includes in-state decortication and CBD extractors? Check and check.</li>
</ul>
<p>So why do some agronomists fear that Kentucky has reached its hemp zenith?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cannabisbenchmarks.com/annual-review-and-outlook-2017-2018-edition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-66014" src="https://mjbizdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1.png" alt="" width="300"></a>It&#8217;s a matter of how big the hemp market is going to get.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of reached a peak,&#8221; said David Williams, a plant and soil scientist at the University of Kentucky, which owns several hemp plots and has done more research than any other U.S. university to study the crop&#8217;s revival.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that hemp production in Kentucky has about met demand from the processing infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Williams was even more negative last November when he addressed a national gathering of entomologists meeting in Denver.</p>
<p>Talking about hemp&#8217;s global market potential, Williams said, &#8220;it&#8217;s not even a grain of sand on the beach of agriculture.&#8221;</p>
<p>A tough analysis, for sure.</p>
<p>Indeed, Kentucky&#8217;s approved total acreage for hemp in 2018 is down slightly from 2017, from 12,800 acres to 12,018 acres.</p>
<p>And though Kentucky authorized 12,800 acres for hemp last year, only about 3,200 acres of hemp were planted.</p>
<p>Kentucky still boasts the nation&#8217;s second-largest hemp industry, threatening Colorado&#8217;s market dominance and teasing a shift in the hemp sector away from Western states to former tobacco-growing areas.</p>
<p>Can the growth continue? Kentucky hemp insiders aren&#8217;t sure.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re at an inflection point, and we need to determine how hard we&#8217;re going to lean in,&#8221; said Chad Rosen, CEO of Victory Hemp Foods and president of the Kentucky Hemp Industries Association.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you need to know about Kentucky&#8217;s hemp market.</p>
<p><strong>Industry snapshot&#160;</strong></p>
<p>Kentucky saw hemp&#8217;s promise as quickly as any state, seizing on the plant as a potential replacement for tobacco, once grown in abundance across the Bluegrass State.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there are two sweet spots in the world to grow hemp, it&#8217;s China and Kentucky,&#8221; said Brian Furnish, president of global production at Ananda Hemp, whose holdings include 600 acres in Cynthiana, Kentucky.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have the latitude. The climate. The soil type. Kentucky is made for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, Kentucky&#8217;s two Republican U.S. Senators, Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell, were instrumental in opening the door for the modern-day U.S. hemp industry.</p>
<p>The Kentuckians steered hemp into the <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/farm-bill-could-pave-the-way-for-billion-dollar-hemp-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2014 Farm Bill</a> and have remained fierce industry advocates even as critics in their own party bemoaned hemp as a gateway to marijuana.</p>
<p>Kentucky authorized hemp production in 2013, a year before the federal government did, and is thought to be the only state using Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement funds to support a hemp industry.</p>
<p>Kentucky has collected more than $2 billion from the tobacco settlement since it was struck in 1998. Half the money goes to the Governor&#8217;s Office of Agriculture Policy, which promotes crops including hemp.</p>
<p>As of 2017, Kentucky had:</p>
<ul>
<li>209 licensed hemp growers</li>
<li>12,800 outdoor acres licensed for cultivation</li>
<li>43 licensed processors</li>
</ul>
<p>Kentucky allows hemp production for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flower</li>
<li>Seed or seed oil</li>
<li>Fiber</li>
</ul>
<p>Some hemp producers in Kentucky say their state&#8217;s embrace of the industry comes not in spite of its resistance to marijuana, but because of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no confusion here. We&#8217;re a hemp-first state. We don&#8217;t get clouded with marijuana,&#8221; said Michael Joseph French, president of AgTech Scientific, a Kentucky hemp company working on a new $5 million hemp-processing plant in the town of Paris.</p>
<p><strong>Market considerations</strong></p>
<p>Kentucky&#8217;s hemp growers are facing the same price pressure seen in other mature cannabis markets &#8211; the days of sky-high prices are over.</p>
<p>Though no formal commodity pricing exists in the hemp market, Kentucky growers surveyed by <em>Marijuana Business Daily</em> report that growers are getting:</p>
<ul>
<li>About $20-$50 per pound of dried flower, depending on CBD content and quality.</li>
<li>About 70-85 cents per pound of seed for pressing into oil.</li>
<li>No reliable price for fiber, because the market is so small.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kentucky&#8217;s future as a hemp-market leader depends on whether the state continues to plow money into promoting the new crop, Rosen said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They say, &#8216;Settlers get the arrows,&#8217; and that definitely happened here, getting hemp off the ground and making mistakes,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a clear opportunity to maintain our dominance as a hemp state, but this is where fatigue sets in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosen&#8217;s company is closing on a deal to start processing hemp in Vermont, but he sees ongoing potential in Kentucky if the state keeps putting money toward the industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have incredible infrastructure available to the hemp industry,&#8221; Rosen said, &#8220;and there&#8217;s a low cost of doing business in Kentucky.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now is when we&#8217;ll see if Kentucky keeps going.&#8221;</p>

<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="14">&#226;&#128;&#156;Endexx has accomplished a great deal since its last interview in August of 2017,&#226;&#128;&#157; said Jolly.&#194;&#160; &#226;&#128;&#156;Revenues are steadily growing and the company has partnered with Impulse Health in development of a new product.&#226;&#128;&#157;</p>

Endexx, with its collaborative partners and consultants, develops and distributes two consumable product lines derived from industrial hemp, which is organic and naturally rich in phytocannabinoids. Phyto-Bites&#194;&#174;, is its CBD-infused soft chews for dogs. The dog treats are formulated to promote health and support the reduction of separation anxiety, pain and inflammation. The company also has two technology products and services that launched in 2014 &#8212; the M3hub and the Autospense&#226;&#132;&#162;. Both products provide essential solutions to promote regulatory compliance and full accountability through &#8220;seed to sale&#8221; inventory management and an &#8220;End of Sale&#8221; technology integration. Based on principles developed by the pharmacological industry, the m3hub platform is the first standardized software solution for tracking pharmaceutical grade marijuana that maintains compliance with federal, state and local regulations. It is intended to provide a smooth transition to eventual federal mandates. The Autospense&#226;&#132;&#162; is a commercial grade inventory control and dispensing device that provides up-to-the-minute accounting details and ensures both product and patient security. By automating the dispensing process, Autospense&#226;&#132;&#162; increases productivity and reduces costs for marijuana retailers, while enhancing their service quality by reducing transaction time for customers.

It leads to significant scratching and, in severe cases, results in excoriations and prurigo nodularis. Although the pathophysiology is not well understood, it is likely multi-factorial, involving immune system dysregulation (including elevated pro-inflammatory activity) and imbalance in the endogenous opioid system.<sup>1</sup>&#194;&#160;Based on annual prescriptions written for the symptomatic treatment of CLD-aP across liver conditions, it is estimated that approximately 2.5 million patients in the United States, or 30-40 percent of patients with CLD, suffer from CLD-aP.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Lawmakers in the Bluegrass State are currently considering a medicinal <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> bill. With it, Kentucky could allow medical marijuana for these conditions.</p>
<p>Legislators from both major parties are working together to pass a medical marijuana law this year. House Bill 166 (HB-166), if passed, would permit patients with serious health conditions to use cannabis therapies.</p>
<p>Members of the House Judiciary Committee are deliberating the bill this week.</p>
<p>Rep. John Sims Jr., a Democrat from Fleming, is the sponsor of the bill. The current measure does not contain a specific list of conditions that would qualify a patient for the program.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>But Jaime Montalvo, of activist group Kentuckians for Medicinal Marijuana, <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/07/medical-marijuana-kentucky-ailments/390873002/" rel="nofollow">told the press</a> that a substitute draft of the bill has been written.</p>
<p>Rep. Sims said the new version of HB-166 is pending introduction.</p>
<h2>Conditions Under Consideration, A to Z</h2>
<p>Lawmakers are considering the following conditions for inclusion in Kentucky&#8217;s medical marijuana program.</p>
<ul class="">
<li class=""><a href="https://hightimes.com/health/marijuana-help-hiv-patients-maintain-mental-stamina/">AIDS (Acquired immune deficiency syndrome)</a></li>

<li class="">Wasting syndrome</li>
</ul>
<h2>Strict Rules for MMJ</h2>
<p>Kentucky&#8217;s medical marijuana program will be strictly regulated under HB-166. Patients with one of the approved conditions would need a recommendation from a physician.</p>
<p>They would have to obtain a required identification card from the state, as well.</p>
<p>Rules will also limit how much medicine a patient could possess at one time.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Doctors would also be required to obtain state approval to issue recommendations to patients.</p>
<h2>Necessary Medicine</h2>
<p>Cannabis advocate Montalvo addressed the judiciary committee on Monday, <a href="https://www.wcpo.com/news/state/state-kentucky/kentucky-lawmakers-begin-review-of-medical-marijuana-bill" rel="nofollow">according to reports</a>. He told lawmakers that there is a legitimate need for medical marijuana in Kentucky.</p>
<p>&#8220;House Bill 166 is not about a party,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not about having fun. This is about sick patients, qualifying patients, having safe access to a plant created by our Creator.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rep. Sims then urged his colleagues on the committee to approve the measure. He noted that sick people were relying on them to act.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is about patients who have exhausted all their options and resources and now are begging us to pull our heads from the sand to help,&#8221; Sims said.</p>
<h2>Law Enforcement Opposition</h2>
<p>As can be expected, law enforcement in the state does not support HB-166.</p>
<p>Keith Cain, the Daviess County Sheriff, testified before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, according to a <a href="https://www.wcpo.com/news/state/state-kentucky/kentucky-medical-marijuana-bill-runs-into-law-enforcement-opposition" rel="nofollow">report in local media</a>.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>He urged the body not approve the bill, while seemingly acknowledging its usefulness.</p>
<p>&#8220;My opposition to this legislation isn&#8217;t because I lack compassion for the sick, but because I think it&#8217;s wrong to herald marijuana &#8212; with its many proven negative qualities,&#8221; said Sheriff Cain.</p>
<p>Chris Cohron, a prosecutor from Warren County, also warned against passage of HB-166.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a road we do not want to go down,&#8221; he said ominously.</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;Kentucky Could Allow Medical Marijuana For These Conditions</h2>
<p>A vote by the judiciary committee to send the measure to the full House for deliberation could happen as soon as today. Rep. Sims is optimistic about the outcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re close on the votes,&#8221; he told reporters.</p>

<p>Shipping your <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a> always comes with considerable risk. While there are certain ways to limit said risk, those involved always face a <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/careful-shipping-drugs-mail-holiday-season/">large degree of precariousness</a>. Two post office employees busted for shipping weed found this out the hard way. The two government employees and civil&#160;servants were arrested and convicted after it was discovered that they had taken advantage of their jobs in the package delivery service in a less-than-legal way.</p>
<h2>A Botched Delivery</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/postal-workers-convicted-in-scheme-to-ship-pot-through-the-mail-476098713.html" rel="nofollow">NBC Chicago</a>, the black market cannabis shipping operation originally took place in 2016 and spanned over the course of five months.</p>
<p>51-year-old Marvin Jones and 44-year-old Angela Wansley, two U.S. Postal Service workers, would regularly intercept packages&#160;containing cannabis and several other unnamed drugs mailed by associate Jayson Smith, a co-defendant in the case.</p>
<p>According to prosecutors, Jones would tip off Smith about unused P.O. boxes and customers who placed mail-hold requests at the post office.</p>
<p>In turn, Smith would mail the drug packages to said locations, while tipping off Jones with mail-tracking information, to ensure Jones or Wansley could intercept the packages before they would get delivered.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

		</div>

<p class="paragraph">Jones and Wansley would accept cash payments from Smith, or sometimes Courtney Poindexter, another defendant, in exchange for the packages.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Following an extensive four-day-trial, Jones and Wansley were convicted of accepting bribes to perform official postal duties, conspiring to commit obstruction of correspondence and obstruction of correspondence.</p>
<p class="paragraph">&#160;If ultimately found guilty, the duo can face up to 15 years in prison for the bribery charge alone.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Additionally, the obstruction of correspondence and conspiracy to commit an obstruction of correspondence&#160;charges can result in an additional ten years of prison time, combined.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>Final Hit:&#160;Post Office Employees Busted For Shipping Weed</h2>
<p>Despite the plant being legal, to some degree, in 29 states and the District of Columbia, shipping marijuana can lead to a world of unnecessary trouble.</p>
<p>Even shipping within the confines of a&#160;weed-legal state could result in drug trafficking charges by the federal government.</p>
<p>Since cannabis still remains <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/attorneys-argue-pots-schedule-i-listing-is-a-civil-rights-violation/">a highly illegal substance in the fed&#8217;s eye</a>, it can result in a lengthy, and frankly, <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/77-year-old-missouri-man-growing-weed/">unfair prison sentence</a>.</p>
<p>And considering both Jones and Wansley were, by definition, government&#160;employees under the U.S. Postal Service, their&#160;scheme could be seen as a somewhat treasonous act by governing officials, and met with stringent and swift punishment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear at the time what the other illicit substances in question were, but for pot alone, the notion of facing up to 25 years in prison is a ludicrous one.</p>
<p>Currently, there are no set dates for the sentencing hearings. Our guess is that the duo would rather know their fates sooner, rather than later.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>The saga of <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/massachusetts-lawmakers-to-restart-talks-on-compromise-marijuana-bill/">legal weed in Massachusetts</a> continues dragging on. But this week, after lawmakers agreed on a basic regulatory framework, we&#8217;re seeing <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a> retail sales in Massachusetts closer than ever.</p>
<h2>Approving Weed Regulations</h2>
<p>Yesterday, the state&#8217;s Cannabis Control Commission (CCC) reached what could be a key milestone. After many months of <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/legalization/everything-need-know-future-pot-massachusetts/">tedious debates and back and forth deliberation</a>, the commission finally approved its final set of regulations.</p>
<p>This newest set of rules received unanimous support, and will now go through a final review by lawyers and the commission&#8217;s executive director.</p>
<p>This review won&#8217;t change any actual policies. Instead, it&#8217;s more of a formality to be sure the language in all documents is correct and error free.</p>
<p>From there, this new set of regulations will be officially filed with the Secretary of State. The CCC has until March 15 to file everything.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Yesterday&#8217;s approval came on the heels of a three-day debate last week in which lawmakers hashed out all sorts of fine-grained details.</p>
<p>In particular, the commission worked to address and incorporate feedback from <a href="https://hightimes.com/dispensaries/gov-baker-oks-waiver-for-massachusetts-1st-pot-dispensary/">Governor Charlie Baker</a> and other key policymakers.</p>
<p>Now that the commission has approved the state&#8217;s regulatory frameworks, they can set their sights on the next key deadline.</p>
<p>The CCC is supposed to start accepting applications from cannabis business owners on April 1.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>If the commission can make that happen on time, then it looks good for the state hitting its goal of <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/massachusetts-top-pot-regulator-committed-to-timely-rollout-of-law/">rolling out retail weed sales</a> on July 1.</p>
<h2>Final Hit: Marijuana Retail Sales In Massachusetts Closer Than Ever</h2>
<p>At this point, lawmakers and members of the CCC are optimistic that they can make the July 1 deadline.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we have a lot of work to do in terms of building our staff and building our technology,&#8221; <a href="http://www.gloucestertimes.com/news/local_news/pot-regulations-ok-d-by-commission/article_8ccb2286-f215-5e56-b315-0d6569d3e329.html" rel="nofollow">said</a> CCC Chairman Steven Hoffman.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I think we have a good foundation based upon these regulations, so I am confident.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;Our intent is to have a go on July 1 and we are hitting all of the deadlines that we have in the legislation, so I&#8217;m feeling good about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the good news. But the bad news is that the state&#8217;s current laws and policies are very <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/massachusetts-lawmakers-justify-tinkering-with-marijuana-legalization/">different from what voters originally approved</a> in 2016.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentC -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc article_middleContentC dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>The first dramatic change came shortly after the vote when the state legislature passed a bill to delay retail sales. That delay bumped it back to the current deadline of July 1, 2018.</p>
<p>Then in 2017, Gov. Baker signed another bill. This one <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/massachusettss-latest-dick-move-rewriting-pot-legalization-in-secret/">raised taxes on weed</a> and gave individual municipalities the option to add even more taxes on top of the increased state tax.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the big things concerning many cannabis advocates is the provision that gives local communities the power to ban weed businesses. By November 2017, 115 communities had already chosen to implement cannabis bans.</p>
<p>Clearly, a lot of questions remain. Similarly, there is still a lot of work that state and local lawmakers need to do before everything is ready for weed businesses to open shop.</p>
<p>But at the moment, it appears that the state&#8217;s basic legal framework for recreational weed is more or less established.</p>

<p>The former major-league relief pitcher was fired as head baseball coach at Fort Worth&#8217;s Texas Wesleyan University after he sent a bizarre response to a high school senior in Aurora, Colo., who had expressed respectful interest in the program.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not recruiting players from the state of Colorado,&#8221; Jeffcoat e-mailed 18-year-old Gavin Bell. &#8220;In the past, players have had trouble passing our drug test. We have made a decision to not take a chance on student-athletes from your state. You can thank your liberal politicians. Best of luck wherever you decide to play.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>
<p>The reference was clearly to Colorado&#8217;s liberal marijuana laws, which permit legal sales and possession of cannabis products. To date, <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2016/10/14/legal-marijuana-laws-by-state-map-united-states/62772/">19 states have legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use</a>.</p>
<p>Bell shared this startling message with his coaches and teachers, and the exchange went viral. TWU authorities fired Bell, making him approximately the 100 millionth American to learn the hard way that foolish or offensive e-mails and social media posts will come back to bite you.</p>
<p>TWU President Fred Slabach announced at a news conference that Jeffcoat &#8220;is no longer an employee &#8230; due to the discriminatory remarks contained in an email to a potential recruit from the state of Colorado,&#8221; as well as to an unrelated possible violation of player eligibility rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;My intention wasn&#8217;t trying to get this guy fired,&#8221; said Gavin, who really does seem like an awfully nice kid, in an interview with a Denver television station. &#8220;My intention was just to try to play baseball.&#8221;</p>

<hr>
<p>TWU didn&#8217;t respond when I e-mailed to ask whether it really has had an abundance of Colorado recruits flunking drug tests. They&#8217;re justifiably ready for this viral episode to exhaust its 15 minutes; Coloradans and their &#8220;liberal politicians&#8221; will no doubt make a full recovery as well.</p>
<p>What really struck me about the Jeffcoat imbroglio, though, was that it illustrates our utter inability to understand or address our nation&#8217;s deeply destructive drug problem.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s because the scourge is so widespread that no one in authority can seem to get beyond the margins, obsessing on one sub-issue at a time. While we have all been hyper-focused on opioid addictions to prescription painkillers and street drugs, there has reportedly been a furious resurgence in the prevalence of methamphetamines.</p>
<p>While this country wages war on south-of-the-border cartels, cheap new synthetics are pouring in from underground labs in China. While we bicker over whether Grandpa should be able to buy pot brownies to relieve his sciatica, legions of Americans know how to obtain illegal and unregulated drugs with the ease of buying a candy bar. We recognize the futility of imprisoning people for simple drug offenses, but we&#8217;re chronically short of treatment options.</p>

<p>We waste millions on testing employees in every sector for minor marijuana use. Yet some industries say they&#8217;re recruiting refugees from other countries because too many U.S. citizens flunk screenings for deadly drugs like heroin and meth.</p>
<p>We just don&#8217;t have enough fingers to poke in all these holes. And we lack a sense of proportion about which problems demand the most urgency. I&#8217;m no expert, but I doubt Colorado&#8217;s pot policy ranks at the top of the list.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Jeffcoat&#8217;s perspective might cost him some seriously valuable recruits. If current-day MLB greats Kris Bryant, Bryce Harper or Joey Gallo were just starting out today, Jeffcoat would give them a pass: All three are from Nevada, which allows recreational marijuana use. Washington, Colorado, Oregon and other states manage to balance legalized pot with valuable professional sports franchises and robust college programs.</p>
<p>Reducing drug use to <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/11/09/drug-tests-urine-doctors/92121/">a simple binomial screening test</a> &#8212; yes or no, pass or fail &#8212; completely ignores the complexities of this issue: which substances we can or cannot trust adults to use responsibly; why some treatments methods are more effective than others; the money involved in illegal drug sales; our inconsistent attitude toward alcohol and other intoxicants.</p>
<p>Most of all, we are getting nowhere on addressing the biggest question of all: Why do so many Americans crave escape from their everyday lives? That&#8217;s the question that underlies every overdose death, every cartel murder, every crooked doctor rung up for running a pill mill.</p>
<p>These are hard issues, and its sometimes seems that we &#8212; all of us, media included &#8212; do little besides talking in circles.</p>
<p>Drugs, in this country, have become as intractable and complex an issue as guns. Examining either through a lens of politics, rather than science or social policy or plain good sense, makes it all so much worse. And it leads some people, like the unfortunate former baseball coach, to make fools of themselves.</p>
<p>There are lot of reasons drugs are an appalling scourge affecting everyone from gang-plagued urban neighborhoods to desperate small towns where the good jobs are all gone and, yes, to athletes.</p>
<p>But I think we can let Colorado off the hook.</p>

<p>There are two main surveys that measure marijuana use among Colorado youth &#8212; one run by the federal government and one run by the state &#8212; and on this topic they agree. A large majority of Colorado high school students are not using marijuana regularly or even infrequently. And a still-sizable majority say they have never used marijuana.</p>
<p>The most recent data from the <a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/PF_Youth_HKCS_MJ-Infographic-Digital.pdf">Healthy Kids Colorado Survey</a>, which is run by the state, is from 2015 &#8212; so, one year after recreational marijuana sales began.

<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="12">The rights of LDS to purchase the memberships of both NHMC Inc. and CSPA Group Inc. were assigned to Kelly Christopherson, the current member of a medical cannabis nursery and a medical cannabis retailer located in Adelanto, CA. In exchange, Ms. Christopherson granted LDS a five-year option to purchase the NHMC, Inc. and CSPA Group, Inc. memberships for one hundred U.S. dollars (US$100.00) each. The assignment was made to facilitate the transfer of the permits described below by the City of Adelanto. On February 21, 2018, the NHMC, Inc. and CSPA Group, Inc. memberships were purchased for one million two hundred and fifty thousand U.S. dollars (US$1,250,000.00) and three million (3,000,000) shares of LDS common stock. The two companies hold three permits in the city of Adelanto in California &#226;&#128;&#148; a Volatile Extraction and Manufacturing permit, a Cultivation permit and a Transportation and Distribution permit. Brad Eckenweiler, CEO of LDS, stated, &#8220;The early completion of the NHMC Inc. and CSPA Group Inc. membership purchase was, I believe, beneficial for all parties involved and we appreciate the work that the Davises contributed to the project.&#8221; The changes in the California regulations during late 2017 made the acceleration of the membership purchase of both NHMC Inc. and CSPA Group Inc. possible. For further information and details of the transaction please refer to the Notice of Proposed Transaction on Form 10 filed with the CSE and to the Material Change Report on Form 51-102F3 the Company filed on Sedar on February 23, 2018.</p>

<p>The tribes floated the idea of setting up rival farms and sales shops on reservations after concluding that rules requiring them to be licensed by the state would strip them of authority over their own lands and their right to self-governance.</p>
<p>The possibility of the tribes breaking away from the state-run system is one more challenge for California as it attempts to transform its longstanding medicinal and illegal marijuana markets into a unified, multibillion-dollar industry.</p>
<p>For tribes to participate in the state-run market, &#8220;they have to give up their rights to act as governments, with regard to cannabis,&#8221; said Mark Levitan, a tribal attorney.</p>
<p>At issue are legally thorny questions about who governs whom, taxation and the intersection of state marijuana laws with tribes that the federal government recognizes as sovereign nations within the U.S.</p>

<hr>
<p>Under regulations issued last year, California would retain full control over licensing. Tribes would have to follow state rules, including &#8220;submission to all enforcement,&#8221; to obtain a license to grow or sell marijuana. Any application must include a waiver of &#8220;sovereign immunity,&#8221; a sort of legal firewall that protects tribal interests.</p>
<p>Without state licenses, businesses cannot take part in the legal state pot market. California has over 100 federally recognized tribes, the most of any state, and estimates of the number either growing and selling pot or eager to do so varies, from a handful to over 20.</p>
<p>Unlike those that have prospered from casino gambling, some are in struggling rural areas and would welcome a new source of cash to improve schools and pave roads.</p>
<p>After long-running negotiations between tribes and state officials failed to produce an agreement before broad legal sales began Jan. 1, the California Native American Cannabis Association warned state officials that tribes &#8220;may engage in commercial cannabis activities through our own inherent sovereign authority.&#8221;</p>
<p>If tribes choose to step away from California&#8217;s market, &#8220;the state will have no jurisdiction to enforce its cannabis laws and regulations on tribal lands,&#8221; the group said in a sharply worded letter to Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown&#8217;s administration in December.</p>
<p>Tribes &#8220;just want to be able to do business in the state of California and elsewhere, just like anybody else,&#8221; said Paul Chavez, former chairman of the Bishop Paiute tribe.</p>

<p>The dispute in California differs from another legal pot state, Washington, where seven tribes have marijuana compacts with the state and others are in negotiations or awaiting the governor&#8217;s approval. The compacts allow tribal marijuana businesses to participate in the legal system, such as selling tribe-grown pot to retailers off the reservation.</p>
<p>In California, the tribes are circulating a proposal that calls for the governor to strike agreements with them. Those pacts would allow them to participate in the legal market, while the state would recognize a tribe&#8217;s &#8220;exclusive authority&#8221; to regulate commercial marijuana activity on its lands.</p>
<p>Tribes are eager for a settlement, but reaching a deal in the Legislature could take the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone agrees conceptually there should be an even playing field, a level playing field,&#8221; said state Assemblyman Rob Bonta, a Democrat at the center of the negotiations in Sacramento.</p>
<p>In addition to the problems in Sacramento, tribes are facing uncertainty at the federal level.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/04/jeff-sessions-rescinding-legalized-marijuana-policy/95875/">lifted an Obama-era policy</a> that kept federal authorities from cracking down on the marijuana trade in states where the drug is legal, which also guided enforcement on tribal lands.</p>
<p>The shifting ground has put a chill over development plans &#8212; including in an isolated stretch of eastern San Diego County.</p>
<p>Nevada-based GB Sciences Inc. announced last year that it would build and manage a commercial cannabis company on tribal lands, nurturing plants, manufacturing products and distributing them across the state.</p>
<p>The tribe, the Los Coyotes Band of Cahuilla and Cupeno Indians, would get an ownership stake, jobs and 40 percent of the profits. GB Sciences would get income for its marijuana research and a foothold in the largest legal pot market in the U.S.</p>
<p>But the projected $8 million project is on hold, with the status of tribes in the pot market unclear.</p>
<p>Issues involving sovereignty touch a sensitive subject for tribes, and they see the predicament with marijuana as part of a history of exploitation.</p>
<p>The state rule &#8220;harkens back to the end of the 19th century &#8230; when federal and state policies favored extermination or forced assimilation of California tribes,&#8221; the tribal group wrote.</p>

    			<p>Nevada retailers sold nearly $200 million worth of recreational cannabis since adult-use sales began six months ago, surpassing the total revenue generated by Colorado and Washington state in the early months of their recreational markets.</p>
<p><span id="more-86732"></span></p>
<p>Nevada&#8217;s higher sales totals relative to other adult-use markets are driven by several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nevada&#8217;s <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/nevada-retailers-still-targeting-july-1-rec-marijuana-start-amid-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early start program</a> &#8211; which allowed licensed dispensaries to sell recreational marijuana while final rules for the adult-use program were ironed out&#160;&#8211; proved extremely successful. Despite initial hurdles regarding <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/nevada-supreme-court-halts-cannabis-distribution-licensing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabis distribution licenses</a>, the state was generally well prepared to handle the influx of new recreational customers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Over 40 million visitors travel to Las Vegas each year, many of whom visit the city primarily for vacation or leisure purposes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Today&#8217;s cannabis industry is very different than it was in 2014, when Colorado and Washington state launched adult-use sales. Branding and retailing practices have advanced significantly, and stores now offer a larger assortment of products that appeal to both new and experienced consumers &#8211; such as low-dose edibles and high-potency concentrates &#8211; that weren&#8217;t widely available in rec markets just a few years ago.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://info.mjfreeway.com/opt-in-consulting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-66014" src="https://mjbizdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2.26_MJ_BizAd300x250-01-1.png" alt="" width="300"></a>Nevada&#8217;s adult-use program has certainly gotten off to a hot start, but rec sales in Colorado and Washington state have grown by leaps and bounds in the years since launch.</p>
<p>Currently, average monthly sales in Nevada are just over $32 million, while Colorado and Washington state&#8217;s average monthly sales over the latest six months of available data are $96.7 million and $79.7 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Whether rec sales in Nevada will grow as dramatically remains to be seen and will depend on how certain aspects of Nevada&#8217;s market develop.</p>
<p>A few things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of retail stores allowed in Nevada will be based on a county&#8217;s population, with initial estimates suggesting this will be around 130 statewide &#8211; fewer stores per capita than any other recreational market. Washington state and Colorado have each issued over 500 adult-use retail licenses.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Rec sales in Nevada have yet to&#160;rise in two consecutive months. This suggests the market is fueled by tourist spending, as sales in Colorado and Washington state &#8211; two markets where in-state residents form the bedrock of the adult-use customer base &#8211; continued to rise for several months before experiencing any month over month declines.</li>

<p>BOISE, Idaho (<em>AP</em>) &#8212; An Idaho Senate panel on Tuesday vacated a decision that halted a proposal to legalize oil extracted from cannabis plants because it was held after an open meeting violation.</p>
<p>Senate Health and Welfare Chairman Lee Heider, a Republican from Twin Falls, asked to vacate Monday&#8217;s vote on HB 577 during the panel&#8217;s Tuesday meeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;The chair acknowledges violation of Senate Rule 20, in that an unnoticed and unapproved executive session occurred,&#8221; Heider said in front of his committee.</p>
<p>Heider then asked for unanimous consent to &#8220;set aside the vote on March 5&#8221; &#8212; which was granted by the committee.</p>
<p>Under HB 577, Idahoans would be allowed to legally use cannabidiol, otherwise known as CBD oil, for medical purposes.</p>
<p>The oil comes from cannabis but contain little or no THC. Supporters tout CBDs as a supplement that can help alleviate pain, reduce stress and improve skin health, although there&#8217;s little data on whether they work or what kind of side effects they might have.</p>
<p>Heider had previously said he wouldn&#8217;t give the bill a hearing because Gov. C.L. &#8220;Butch&#8221; Otter opposed the legislation.</p>
<p>However, Heider raised eyebrows Monday by halting a public meeting to ask members to meet in private about HB 577.</p>
<p>Heider stopped the meeting because Sen. Tony Potts, a Republican from Idaho Falls, attempted to force the bill forward making an unannounced motion to schedule a hearing on the issue. Such actions are unusual for legislative committees.</p>
<p>While Potts talked in support of the advancing the bill, Heider gaveled him down and huddled members into his office.</p>
<p>Shouting could be heard from inside Heider&#8217;s office and the group only broke up after being warned by a reporter that lawmakers were likely violating the Open Meeting Law.</p>
<p>&#8220;The governor&#8217;s office doesn&#8217;t want this bill,&#8221; Heider could be heard shouting while explaining why he wouldn&#8217;t give the bill a hearing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still unknown if Heider will allow the bill to advance by giving it a hearing. Yet, his actions have sparked criticism from CBD advocates and political candidates who have used the issue to criticize the current administration.</p>
<p>&#8220;If this administration has real valid reasons to oppose the CBD oil legislation, they should present them in a public, open forum,&#8221; said U.S. Rep. Raul Labrador, who is running in the GOP gubernatorial primary. &#8220;They should defeat ideas in committee, not hide behind a committee chairman to avoid the public debate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Labrador also accused Lt. Gov. Brad Little &#8212; who is also running for governor &#8212; of remaining on the sidelines while Otter usurped the legislative process.</p>
<p>Little hadn&#8217;t seen Labrador&#8217;s statement when asked by reporters on Tuesday and declined to respond directly to Labrador&#8217;s attack. Little added that he supported &#8220;quality-controlled CBD oil,&#8221; but had not yet read HB 577.</p>
<p>&#8220;From an administrative side, I&#8217;m glad Lee fessed up,&#8221; Little said. &#8220;Obviously, it was circumvention.&#8221;</p>
<p>Otter&#8217;s spokesman said the Republican governor was traveling Monday and declined to comment further.</p>
<p>Otter vetoed similar legislation in 2015 and has since said his stance on CBD oil had not changed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fellow GOP opponent Tommy Ahlquist&#8217;s campaign also released a statement criticizing Otter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since day one, Tommy has supported the legalization of CBD oil that helps sick people as long as the THC is removed and it&#8217;s prescribed by a doctor,&#8221; said David Johnston, Ahlquist&#8217;s campaign manager.</p>

The judge in the case, looking over a depleted jury pool, ruled that there were not enough prospective jurors to proceed, and declared a mistrial.<br>
</p>
<div id="leafly-dfp-ad-widget-mobile-medium-rectangle-1237049116" class="leafly-dfp-ad-container">    </div>
<p>The trial has been re-scheduled for mid-July.</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">Prospective jurors questioned the decision to bring charges, even before the judge declared a mistrial. </div>
<p>The early dismissal disappointed some courtroom observers, who were anticipating one of the first high-profile cases to be prosecuted under Denver&#8217;s post-legalization public consumption law.</p>
<p>Three founding members of the <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/lifestyle/inside-denvers-international-church-of-cannabis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Church of Cannabis</a> stand accused by Denver city officials of violating Colorado&#8217;s Clean Indoor Air Act. They have also been cited for complicity in the public consumption of cannabis during what was billed as a private 4/20 service at the church. The 4/20 service also served as the high point of the Church&#8217;s official opening day.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/lifestyle/inside-denvers-international-church-of-cannabis"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/26104805/cannabis-church-1-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">A &#8216;Higher&#8217; Calling: Inside Denver&#8217;s International Church of Cannabis</div></div></a></div>
<h2>A Private Event on 4/20</h2>
<p>The charges were filed after several undercover police officers entered the church and attended the April 20<sup>th</sup> event on the unofficial marijuana holiday. The church first had visiting hours for the public, and then held the private invitation-only service at 4:20 p.m.</p>
<p>Prosecutors claim that the defendants were complicit in fostering the public use of cannabis in an enclosed space. They have not been charged with public use.</p>
<p>But those defendants counter that they met with Denver city attorneys several days before the 4/20 event last year, specifically to ask how they could hold their 4/20 ceremony and remain in compliance with city laws. They also claim that the event was private and not open to the public. Therefore, they say, it should not violate the city&#8217;s public consumption laws.</p>
<h2>Not Enough Jurors</h2>
<p>Soon after preliminary interviews of jurors by the prosecution and defense, the judge announced that the jury pool of 24, which was whittled down to 15, was not large enough to seat the six necessary jurors. Therefore, the trial would not be able to proceed.</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">''I pay taxes and wonder how my tax dollars are being utilized,'' one juror told the judge.</div>
<p>&#8220;Each side had six preemptory challenges,&#8221; defense attorney Warren Edson after the judge&#8217;s decision. &#8220;So if you take 12 away from 15, we didn&#8217;t have six.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before both sides agreed to the mistrial, the judge questioned several jurors. That&#8217;s when things got interesting. Several <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/jury-acquits-nice-guy-who-admitted-selling-cannabis-to-a-cop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jurors questioned</a> whether such a case was necessary in a state that legalized recreational, adult-use cannabis more than four years earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;I pay taxes and wonder how my tax dollars are being utilized,&#8221; one juror told the judge.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m struggling with the amount of resources put towards this,&#8221; said another, who also noted that Denver Police at the city&#8217;s Red Rocks Amphitheater often &#8220;look the other way&#8221; when encountering cannabis-smokers at the famous open-air concert venue.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/jury-acquits-nice-guy-who-admitted-selling-cannabis-to-a-cop"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/15105744/jury-nullification-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Jury Acquits &#8216;Nice Guy&#8217; Who Admitted Selling Cannabis to a Cop</div></div></a></div>
<p>Defense attorney Warren Edson was pleased with the pushback. &#8220;It was nice to see the citizens of Denver bring up the point&#8212;not me, they did&#8212;that geez, the city seems to be spending a lot of time and money on this case,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>There do seem to be a lot of resources spent on a relatively minor infraction, if an infraction did indeed occur. The charges listed each carry a maximum penalty of $300. The case has already gone through at least five pretrial hearings.</p>
<p>The risk for the defendants could be substantially greater, though. While the public consumption charge is only a public nuisance crime, Edson said the city can conceivably file forfeiture paperwork against the International Church of Cannabis if the defendants are found guilty. &#8220;And that is where this is headed,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>This Is &#8216;Religious Persecution,&#8217; Says Defendant</h2>
<p>Denver City Attorney&#8217;s Office did not respond to requests for comment on the mistrial or the International Church of Cannabis case.</p>
<p>Church co-founder Steve Berke, one of the defendants at the trial, said the city doesn&#8217;t believe &#8220;that our principles are deeply-held religious beliefs. This comes down, in my opinion, to religious persecution.&#8221;</p>
<p>As prosecutors and the defense team prepares for the rescheduled trial in July, the City of Denver continues to move forward with licenses for public cannabis consumption spaces. Earlier this week a Denver coffee shop <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2018/02/26/denver-approves-first-social-marijuana-license/">received approval</a> for what may be the city&#8217;s first business license to allow customers to enjoy on-site cannabis use.</p>

											    	<p>It&#8217;s no secret that LeBron James might be making his last playoff run as a Cavalier.</p>
<p>Sure, it&#8217;s Oscar season and the NBA campaign is six weeks away from being over, but it&#8217;s never too early to start talking about King James&#8217; much-anticipated free-agent decision.</p>
<p>This past week, in a stunt inspired by Oscar-favorite <em>Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri</em>, three billboards practically <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22596146/cleveland-cavaliers-star-lebron-james-says-flattered-billboards-recruiting-join-philadelphia-76ers" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">begging</a> LeBron to sign in Philadelphia were put up about seven miles outside of Cleveland.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone " src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7aTnQqygA3TcukFi/giphy.gif" width="668" height="376"></p>
<p>But are the Sixers a realistic choice?</p>
<p>With their young nucleus, they seem to be. But what about other teams loom large this summer for LeBron&#8217;s big decision?</p>
<h4>Philadelphia 76ers</h4>
<p>Sam Hinkie, the former 76ers GM and mastermind behind &#8220;The Process,&#8221; doesn&#8217;t look so bad anymore.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone " src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l4FGqK8Dh3W3YmpwI/giphy.gif" width="629" height="354"></p>
<p>It took a lot of time and losing, but the Sixers have developed into one of the best young teams in the league. With two transcendent talents in Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, LeBron James would make that team the most dangerous in the Eastern Conference.</p>
<p>Signing James, and adding much more shooting, would complete The Process.</p>
<h4>Los Angeles Lakers</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone " src="https://media.giphy.com/media/26vIfKDKOw34lHRks/giphy.gif" width="636" height="358"></p>
<p>There were reports last summer that LeBron James to the Lakers was practically a done deal. Now, nothing is ever for sure with LeBron until he signs on the dotted line, but the Lakers absolutely make sense.</p>
<p>While the Lakers have been one of the worst teams in the NBA over the last half decade, the team has a fun, young nucleus that includes rookie Kyle Kuzma, budding star Brandon Ingram and a point guard who doesn&#8217;t need the ball and can play solid defense in Lonzo Ball.</p>
<p>But why would LeBron want to join a team that hasn&#8217;t been to the playoffs since 2011?</p>
<p>James, 33, has already started to build his empire, that includes his production company that is based in Los Angeles. He also owns more than $50 million in real estate in the L.A. area.</p>
<p>The Lakers will have cap space for LeBron and one other max star, say Paul George? And if LeBron doesn&#8217;t want to deal with the LaVar ball headache, the Lakers can always trade Lonzo for a nice haul.</p>
<h4>Cleveland Cavaliers</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone " src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7btLPD9OZCxRbiIU/giphy.gif" width="626" height="352"></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t count out James staying at home with the Cavaliers.</p>
<p>Although James and Cavs owner Dan Gilbert reportedly don&#8217;t have a working relationship, LeBron still runs that team and obviously feels comfortable with the franchise.</p>
<p>Before the trade deadline, this looked like a long shot, but Cleveland upgraded in talent around LeBron, surrounding him with more shooting and athleticism.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t the best option for LeBron, but will he stay with the hometown squad or leave them high and dry again?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll find out in July.</p>

											    	<p>When I first heard that there was an opportunity for <em>DOPE Magazine </em>to cover <em>The 4th Annual Hollywood Beauty Awards, </em>my initial reaction was intrigue and surprise. Surprising because it&#8217;s not every day that you see cannabis media outlets covering Hollywood award shows, but intriguing because they were specifically looking for coverage of their <em>#HighOnBeauty </em>campaign. The <em>Hollywood Beauty Awards </em>recognizes the architects of beauty in hair, makeup, photography and styling in Film, TV and Music, as well as those artists who create celebrity looks for the red carpet and editorial. Pamela Price, the Vice President of the <em>HBA&#8217;s, </em>had also clued me in that they would be awarding <em>CBD For Life, </em>a CBD infused pain management and beauty product line, <em>Product Line of the Year</em>. This was also to be the <em>HBA&#8217;s </em>first cannabis product ever awarded.</p>

<p>So with suit in hand, I made my way from Las Vegas to Los Angeles to attend the <em>Hollywood Beauty Awards </em>at <em>Avalon Hollywood </em>on Vine<em>. </em>Upon arriving, I met fellow <em>DOPE-fam </em>member Dan Schmink, who was styled vibrantly in his dapper blue plaid suit. We had a quick get-to-know-ya toke to ease the nerves and headed to find our position on the green carpet. Once we tested our WiFi connection, we MacGyvered a cell phone mount to our tripod rental and set the stage for an electric two hour live stream on <em>DOPE&#8217;s Instagram </em>profile.</p>
<figure id="attachment_34635" style="max-width: 746px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-34635" src="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kerry-Washington_Sam-Jackson_Elizabeth-Banks.jpg" alt="Hollywood Gets #HIGHONBEAUTY - Hollywood Beauty Awards" width="746" height="1100" srcset="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kerry-Washington_Sam-Jackson_Elizabeth-Banks.jpg 746w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kerry-Washington_Sam-Jackson_Elizabeth-Banks-694x1024.jpg 694w" sizes="(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Kerry Washington, Samuel L Jackson, Elizabeth Banks (Hollywood Beauty Awards)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The presenters, nominees, and those receiving awards started arriving around 5PM. It was a whirlwind of celebrities, fashionistas, and some of the most talented artists on the planet. I moved back and forth between the live stream and the photographer pit to capture as much content as possible. We were surrounded by media outlets with microphones and camera crews, but it didn&#8217;t stop us from getting interviews with A-list talent. One of the first celebs to stop and discuss cannabis with us was Smokey Robinson<em>. </em>He received the Gentleman&#8217;s Award that evening for his kind heart toward those around him throughout his music career. Smokey doesn&#8217;t spark up nowadays, but is very excited and happy for those who now have access to cannabis.</p>
<p>We also spoke to a number of cannabis-friendly nominees and awardees about CBD and cannabis within their fields; such as Ellen Mirojnick, Matthew VanLeeuwen, Camille Friend, Joel Harlow, Riawna Capri, Johnny Wright, and Sarah Tanno, the personal makeup artist for CBD advocate, Lady Gaga.</p>

<p>Cannabis is still a touchy subject for many people. Not everyone who I spoke with was thrilled to talk about marijuana, but as journalists and writers it is our duty to ask the questions no one else is willing to ask. The <em>HBA&#8217;s </em>are a beacon of hope for cannabis within the health and beauty industry. President and founder, Michele Elyzabeth, intends to increase the amount of cannabis influence each year, so that the true medicinal value of the plant can continue to be recognized by Hollywood and mainstream America.</p>

											    	<p>With recreational cannabis now available in California, many have wondered what will happen to the already-saturated California real estate market. Legalization in Colorado, for instance, had a huge impact on real estate. <a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/enforcement/med-licensed-facilities" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Dispensaries in Colorado now outnumber</a> Starbucks, 7-Eleven and McDonalds locations combined, and they even outnumber liquor stores by five percent. This change has led to a dramatic decrease in warehouse vacancies and storefronts, as well as an oversaturation of the market. And that hasn&#8217;t stopped people from moving to Colorado! For the last few years, Colorado has been one of the top ten states for growth&#8212;adding over 75,000 new residents last year, according to the <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2017/estimates-idaho.html" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">U.S. Census Bureau</a>.</p>
<p>Will this pattern hold for California? It seems likely. We spoke to Dr. Jonathan Vaught, Founder and CEO of Front Range Biosciences, to get his insight. Currently, Front Range Biosciences is headquartered in Boulder, Colorado, but Vaught sees California as their next step for expansion. So far, he&#8217;s found trying to acquire California property as a canna-business owner, an interesting experience, to say the least.</p>
<h5><em>DOPE Magazine:</em> What hoops have you had to jump through to find real estate in California?</h5>
<p><strong><em>Dr. Jonathan Vaught:</em></strong> Finding real estate for cannabis definitely has its challenges. With the massive wave of legalization across the world, there has been increased demand for commercial real estate in certain hotspots or major markets&#8212;California in particular. Given that many agricultural companies doing crop production and nursery operations have been moved overseas, these real estate assets have been left unused for well over a decade, sometimes more. Dilapidated old greenhouses and warehouses are now going for as much as ten times what they used to cost on a per-square-foot basis. Because of the poor state of many properties, significant capital investments are required, which is challenging for a startup company.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34609" src="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ertwretw.jpg" alt="Legalized Cannabis Spikes the California Real Estate Market" width="1625" height="833" srcset="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ertwretw.jpg 1625w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ertwretw-768x394.jpg 768w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ertwretw-1024x525.jpg 1024w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ertwretw-770x395.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1625px) 100vw, 1625px"></p>
<p>In addition, many landlords and property owners are more reluctant to rent to cannabis businesses, which further drives up prices and perpetuates the notion that cannabis companies should pay significantly higher rent. However, just like any other agricultural crop, this one will eventually get commoditized, and business owners will not be able to afford the astronomical prices currently seen. This is already starting to happen in certain markets where cannabis cultivators cannot afford their rent anymore, given the falling price per pound of product.</p>
<p>We have had to be extremely persistent and use our network to connect with property owners, real estate agents and consultants to help identify good properties. I think the biggest pitfalls are the uncertain local regulations. Many counties and municipalities in California are still working on their regulations, which can make a property either suitable or not for cannabis, depending on the type of license required. With the possibility that regulations could change, there is significant risk to investing heavily in a particular property until the local government has issued their final regulations. This has apparently happened to several groups that had built large operations that are [now] no longer permitted [to operate] under the latest version of local regulations.</p>
<h5>What has been the hardest (and, alternatively, easiest) part of getting your business set up in California?</h5>
<p>It&#8217;s a very competitive space, with the powerful agricultural companies that fuel much of California&#8217;s economy watching the industry very closely, lobbying at state and local levels, and even making investments. There is also significant competition from the traditional cannabis producers that have been operating in California for decades. However, given the state&#8217;s existing infrastructure to support agricultural companies, there are many reasons why setting up in California also has its advantages. Legislators, businesses and regulators are all very used to working together to support an agricultural-driven economy.</p>
<h5>Why did you choose California?</h5>
<p>California will be the largest legal cannabis market in the world. It will also be one of the largest producers of cannabis in the world, given its climate and infrastructure to support large-scale crop production. With our Clean Stock&#8482; nursery program, it makes the most sense for our company to be right in the middle of the largest cannabis-producing region in the world, where demand for our product is highest.</p>

<p>Thanks to a <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> activism group selling &#8216;Jeff Sessions&#8217; rolling papers, you can now send a clear political message the next time you roll up.

<p>The cannabis activism group selling &#8216;Jeff Sessions&#8217; rolling papers calls itself simply #JeffSesh. The group&#8217;s <a href="http://https://jeff-sesh.squarespace.com" rel="nofollow">website</a>&#160;sells two versions of what they&#8217;re calling General Jeff&#8217;s Sessions Papers. One comes in a black box and the other comes in a white box.</p>
<p>Each box design features a picture of <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/lawsuit-jeff-sessions-court-tomorrow/">Attorney General Jeff Sessions</a>&#8216; face right in the center. He&#8217;s got a joint in his mouth, and it looks like his eyes may be slightly red. Each box comes with 50 papers, and celebrates the fact that these Jeff Sessions papers are part of a &#8220;Limited 1st Edition.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group behind these genius <a href="https://hightimes.com/products/best-rolling-papers-2017/">rolling papers</a> is working to make a political statement while also maintaining a sense of humor. To that end, they&#8217;ve really elevated the world of cannabis puns.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

		</div>

<p>The rolling paper boxes advertise 50 &#8220;sessions&#8221; per box. Similarly, the top of the box reminds consumers to &#8220;Please Sesh Responsibly.&#8221; Finally, playing on Sessions&#8217; middle name, the very bottom of the box has the line: &#8220;Don&#8217;t Beauregard That Joint, My Friend!&#8221;</p>
<h2>Final Hit: Cannabis Activism Group Selling &#8216;Jeff Sessions&#8217; Rolling Papers</h2>
<div id="attachment_182235" style="max-width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-182235" src="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/cannabis-activism-group-selling-jeff-sessions-rolling-papers-2.jpg" alt="Cannabis Activism Group Selling ''Jeff Sessions'' Rolling Papers" width="1000" height="508"><p class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fa fa-camera"></i> #JeffSesh</p></div>
<p>The group&#8217;s website is equally punny in articulating its pro-cannabis politics. According to the site, the Jeff Sessions-themed rolling papers are part of a larger campaign to tell <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/heres-jeff-sessions-latest-attack-marijuana/">Jeff Sessions</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not criminals, junkies or idiots. Regular Jeffs all over the country&#8212;good, responsible, patriotic Americans&#8212;have a sesh now and then . . . and it&#8217;s OK!&#8221;</p>
<p>Additionally, the group provides a number of key stats about weed. Many of them fly in the face of the prohibitionist <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/more-marijuana-myths-jeff-sessions-slams-legalization-again/">myths</a> Sessions himself so often perpetuates.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>&#8220;Cannabis provides relief and uplifting energy to millions of users, from serious medical patients in 29 states to recreational consumers in 8 states,&#8221; the site says. &#8220;<a href="https://hightimes.com/news/legalization/states-pass-marijuana-laws-year/">12 states are considering new legalization</a> measures this year. Every time you sesh with any brand of JeffSesh papers, you&#8217;re helping keep the law moving forward&#8212;and not back to the <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/white-house-confession-the-war-on-weed-is-racist/">Nixon era</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeff Sessions is a logical target for a cannabis activist group. Throughout his entire political career, Sessions has been an outspoken opponent of weed.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/jeff-sessions-coming-war-on-legal-marijuana-214501" rel="nofollow">example</a>, he once said the KKK was &#8220;OK until I found out they smoked pot.&#8221; Similarly, Sessions also said that &#8220;good people don&#8217;t smoke marijuana.&#8221; And finally, he regularly calls cannabis a &#8220;very real danger&#8221; and rails against it as &#8220;not the kind of thing that ought to be legalized.&#8221;</p>
<p>More recently, the Attorney General suggested that cannabis is to <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/jeff-sessions-blames-marijuana-opioid-crisis/">blame for the opioid crisis</a>. While commenting on the opioid epidemic at a Heritage Foundation event, Sessions claimed that &#8220;a lot of this is starting with marijuana or other drugs, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Sessions&#8217; anti-weed propaganda is extending into policy. Earlier this year, he <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/jeff-sessions-anti-pot-federal-crackdown-full-force/">rescinded an Obama-era policy</a> prohibiting federal resources from going after states with legal cannabis programs.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>Owning your <a href="https://hightimes.com/business/5-tips-to-start-a-successful-and-legal-grow-operation/">own grow operation</a> can be tough, especially in inclement weather conditions. Typically, it&#8217;s traditional outdoor setups that are <a href="https://hightimes.com/grow/nicos-nuggets-tips-on-growing-marijuana-outdoors/">most afflicted by mother nature</a>. However, there&#160;can notable exceptions. Take this recent case, for example, where melted&#160;snow on a roof leads to marijuana bust worth over $100,000.</p>
<h2>A Conspicuous Roof</h2>
<p>Storm Emma continues to wreak havoc amongst the U.K., with some areas expected to see almost two feet of snow. Nonetheless, it was actually a noticeable lack of snow that resulted in one illegal grow operation&#8217;s downfall.</p>
<p>On Friday, police shut down a marijuana grow farm worth around &#163;80,000, (or in U.S. terms, $110,000), after noticing the roof had little snow on it.</p>
<p>This was, of course, because of the heat given off by the <a href="https://hightimes.com/grow/nicos-nuggets-how-to-compare-cannabis-grow-lights/">high powered grow-lights</a>, which melted the majority of the snow on the roof.</p>
<p>According to the&#160;<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5453881/Police-80-000-cannabis-farm-seeing-snow-free-roof.html" rel="nofollow">Daily Mail</a>, police entered the house after smelling a strong cannabis odor outside of the house, in addition to the noticeable lack of snow.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>There, they found about 322 cannabis plants spread throughout all four bedrooms of the house and the cellar.</p>
<p>PC Caroline Foster of the West Yorkshire Police, who was a part of the drug bust, proudly tweeted the department&#8217;s findings on her personal Twitter account.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whilst the snow has kept the burglars at bay it has also helped us in finding some rather large plants,&#8221; Foster said.&#160;&#8220;Hmmm, I wonder why there is no snow on your roof? 280+ plants seized from an address in Keighley today, some nearly 6ft tall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vicky Watson, who lives directly next to the since-exposed cannabis operation, told the Daily Mail that there were several signs of a marijuana farm.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8220;In the cold weather my house is normally freezing because the insulation is rubbish, but since they moved in next door my bathroom has been absolutely red hot. The wall was warm to touch,&#8221; Watson explained.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8220;It was suspicious, you could hear fans whirring but no normal sounds of people living there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another anonymous neighbor praised the West Yorkshire Police for their discovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well done for the police turning out on such a freezing cold day to take those drugs off the streets. Now those cannabis farmers have lost their crop I dread to think how they are going to afford their leccy [electricity] bill.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;Melted Snow on A Roof Leads To Marijuana Bust Worth Over $100,000</h2>
<p>Despite police uncovering the large grow operation, no formal arrests have been made, as there was no one in the house at the time of the discovery.</p>
<p>The only lead, if you can call it that, was from Watson, who described her neighbors as&#160;&#8216;Two Eastern European blokes, in their 30s.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>ALONG THE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR (<em>AP</em>) &#8212; Marijuana, specifically legalizing it for recreational use, was a hot topic Thursday aboard New Jersey&#8217;s annual cocktail party on rails.</p>
<p>For more than eight decades New Jersey&#8217;s business leaders, lobbyists and politicians pack a chartered Amtrak train for Washington, making it part boozy networking event, part lobbying session.</p>
<p>Thursday&#8217;s event comes as Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy begins a push for legalization of marijuana. Democratic lawmakers in the state Senate have drafted a bill and held hearings, but now that Murphy succeeded Republican Chris Christie, a vocal opponent of legalization, legislators are hesitating.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve said from the outset that we&#8217;re going to try to do a thorough job for the people of New Jersey,&#8221; Democratic Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin said. Coughlin has scheduled a hearing on marijuana legalization for Monday.</p>
<p>Other Democrats aboard the train seemed skeptical. Democratic Assemblywoman Annette Quijanao said she&#8217;s still reviewing the issue and hasn&#8217;t made up her mind. Democratic state Sen. Bob Gordon says he&#8217;s opposed but open to considering legalization. Republicans look less likely to embrace it.</p>
<p>Senate Republican Leader Tom Kean Jr., seated next to his father, former GOP Gov. Tom Kean Sr., said he&#8217;s opposed.</p>
<p>Murphy says he favors legalization based on criminal and racial justice philosophies but also that the estimated $300 million in state revenue would help finance his other promises, like increased pension payments and greater school aid.</p>
<p>Murphy&#8217;s first budget is due in just under two weeks. He said he will outline his budget priorities in an address to the train delegation in Washington on Thursday.</p>
<p>Also speaking to the delegation will be New Jersey&#8217;s U.S. senators, Cory Booker and Bob Menendez, both Democrats.</p>
<p>The train party is typically an opportunity for entrepreneurs and lobbyists to deepen relationships with lawmakers, but it also gives the state&#8217;s leaders &#8212; particularly the governor &#8212; a chance to frame an agenda.</p>
<p>Christie, for example, last year touted his accomplishments and warned the then-candidates running to succeed him not to over-promise.</p>
<p>This year, Democrats are energized over the prospects of picking up seats in Congress.</p>
<p>State Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg, a Democrat, said New Jersey Republicans will have a hard time distancing themselves from President Donald Trump, who is unpopular in the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;We certainly as a party more closely represent the values of a majority of the residents of the state,&#8221; Weinberg said</p>
<p>Kean Jr., who&#8217;s not on the ballot this year, said he&#8217;s focused on policies to make New Jersey more affordable. But how will the president affect Republicans on the ballot?</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the research published in the journal </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Neuropsychopharmacology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, clinical trial data showed that when cannabis was administered alongside &#8220;sub-therapeutic doses&#8221; of oxycodone, the two worked synergistically to relieve the patient&#8217;s pain as effectively as a higher dose of strictly oxycodone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted by a team of researchers from the United States and Australia. Subjects were divided into three groups. One was administered inhaled cannabis, the other low-dose oxycodone and the third received both. Researchers examined their response over the course of treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The study showed that neither the low-dose oxycodone nor the smoked cannabis subsided the subjects&#8217; pain alone, but the combination of the two proved effective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Both active cannabis and a low dose of oxycodone (2.5 mg) were sub-therapeutic, failing to elicit analgesia on their own,&#8221; said </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-018-0011-2"><span style="font-weight: 400">the study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. &#8220;However, when administered together, pain responses &#8230; were significantly reduced, pointing to the opioid-sparing effects of cannabis.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Smoked cannabis combined with an ineffective analgesic dose of oxycodone produced analgesia comparable to an effective opioid analgesic dose.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A </span><a href="http://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1532-6535/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">similar study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> conducted in 2011 found similar results with vaporized cannabis. That study shows states with legalized medical marijuana have seen a reduction in not only fatal overdoses but painkiller prescriptions overall.</span></p>

<ul class="canvas-list List(d)" data-type="list" data-reactid="14">
<li data-reactid="15">These increases were driven by record revenues in our Operations segment, Next Big Crop, which had increased revenues of 323% and 193%, respectively, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same periods for 2016.&#194;&#160; As the number of states with regulated marijuana markets has increased, Next Big Crop has found a steady increase in demand for its services.</li>
<li data-reactid="16">Our Marketing segment, Chiefton, experienced 95% and 26%, respectively, increases in revenue during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 when compared to 2016.&#194;&#160; We added a new managing director in August 2017 to focus on our apparel business, which positively impacted revenues for both apparel sales and design revenue.</li>
<li data-reactid="17">Our Security segment, Iron Protection Group, experienced 11% and 16%, respectively, decreases in revenue during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, when compared to 2016.&#194;&#160; As previously discussed, IPG is impacted by the drop in wholesale cannabis prices in Colorado. &#194;&#160;In late August 2017, we acquired Mile High Protection Services, which provides us the opportunity to expand our security business into the non-cannabis space, as we believe that provides an opportunity for growth.&#194;&#160; We have also obtained our license to operate in California, and expect IPG to see significant growth in that market in 2018.</li>

<div id="leafly-dfp-ad-widget-mobile-medium-rectangle-779355103" class="leafly-dfp-ad-container">    </div>
<p>More than 60 percent of the more than 2,200 patients surveyed by the state report benefits from using marijuana in inhaled or pill forms during the first five months after Minnesota approved cannabis to treat pain. The survey also found that 43 percent of doctors observed medical marijuana having a positive effect on patients.</p>

<p>The report surveyed patients who used cannabis in 2016 for the first time to treat chronic pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s heartening to see that this fairly large proportion achieved that degree of reduction in their pain assessment score,&#8221; said Dr. Tom Arneson, research manager for the office of medical cannabis.</p>
<p>More than 350 patients involved in the study initially reported using opioid painkillers. Nearly 63 percent reported reduced or eliminated opioid usage after six months of using medical cannabis.</p>
<p>There were no reports of cannabis use that was life-threatening or required hospitalization.</p>

<p>Officials believe the results are encouraging, but say more research is necessary. A controlled study that includes giving some participants a placebo is needed, Arneson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need more research into the potential value of medical cannabis in pain management, especially as our communities grapple with the harmful impacts of opioids and other medications now in use for that purpose,&#8221; Arneson said.</p>
<p>About 10 percent of patients reported no benefit, while as much as 40 percent experienced mild side effects such as fogginess or fatigue. At least one patient found that the positive effects of cannabis were only temporary.</p>

<p>During a press conference on opioids at an Ohio inpatient facility that treats newborns suffering from prenatal drug exposure, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said, &#8220;There really is no such thing as medical <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a>&#8220;. The statement came on the heels of questions about the viability of medical cannabis as an alternative to opioid painkillers. So while Ohio is preparing to launch its legal medical cannabis program, Health Secretary Alex Azar denies existence of medical marijuana.</p>
<h2>Health Secretary Alex Azar Denies Existence Of Medical Marijuana</h2>
<p>Bridge&#8217;s Path is an inpatient facility in Kettering, Ohio. Physicians there treat newborns diagnosed with prenatal drug exposure. And increasingly, newborns are suffering from prenatal exposure to opioids.</p>
<p>Deaths from prescription and illicit opioid abuse have skyrocketed in recent years. Today, opioids are the <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/detroit-opioid-overdose-deaths-murders/">leading cause of death</a> for Americans under 50.</p>
<p>Last October, President Trump decried the opioid epidemic as a National Public Health Emergency. But critics <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/trump-finally-declares-opioid-epidemic-a-public-health-emergency/">blasted the move</a> as largely symbolic.</p>
<p>More recently, reports have surfaced that Trump frequently expresses a desire to <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/donald-trump-execution-drug-dealers/">execute every drug dealer in America</a>.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Those close to the president qualified his statements as meaning large-volume drug traffickers pedaling synthetic opioids like fentanyl.</p>
<p>During the press conference at Bridge&#8217;s Path, Trump&#8217;s health chief described the funding the government is devoting to combating the opioid crisis.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are devoting hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of research at our National Institutes of Health as part of the historic $13 billion opioid and serious mental illness program that the president and Congress are funding,&#8221; Azar <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/national/such-thing-medical-marijuana-health-secretary-says/eZkOYR0zXTghh1seUvQPAI/" rel="nofollow">said</a>.</p>
<p>Azar went on to describe how &#8220;over $750 million just in 2019 alone is going to be dedicated towards the National Institutes of Health working in public-private partnership to try and develop the next generation of pain therapies that are not opioids.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Yet when asked what role he sees medical marijuana playing as a next-generation <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/rep-earl-blumenauer-testified-medical-marijuana-could-combat-the-opioid-epidemic/">alternative to opioids</a>, Azar had this to <a href="https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/local/such-thing-medical-marijuana-health-secretary-says-dayton/La8dTJgu6nF3ojSc1z6yPO/" rel="nofollow">say</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no FDA-approved use of marijuana, a botanical plant. I just want to be very clear about that.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Alex Azar, Former Big Pharma Exec, Says Cannabis Has No Medical Value</h2>
<p>When Azar says there&#8217;s &#8220;is no FDA-approved&#8221; use of marijuana, he&#8217;s correct in a purely technical sense. Indeed, the federal government still considers marijuana a <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/pediatricians-demand-dea-reclassify-cannabis/">Schedule I drug</a>.</p>
<p>But that is not the same thing as saying &#8220;there really is no such thing as medical marijuana&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="https://hightimes.com/health/science/cannabinoids-interact-pain-circuits/">Multiple studies</a> and countless patient testimonies provide a strong for the safety and effectiveness of cannabis as a pain reliever. At the very least, the data calls for further study, not outright dismissals.</p>
<p>But a quick survey of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Azar" rel="nofollow">Alex Azar&#8217;s r&#233;sum&#233;</a> might reveal why the former Big Pharma executive is taking such a baffling stance against medical cannabis.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentC -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc article_middleContentC dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Azar represents exactly the kind of revolving door from lobbying firms to public office that Trump promised he would put an end to with his &#8220;drain the swamp&#8221; campaign platform.</p>
<p>Azar was US Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services for George W. Bush before becoming President of Eli Lilly and Company, a major pharmaceutical firm, from 2012 to 2017.</p>
<p>During that time, Azar also served on the board of directors of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, a large pharmaceutical lobby.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s safe to assume the &#8220;public-private&#8221; partnerships Azar mentioned in the Kettering press conference would benefit drug companies like Eli Lilly.</p>
<p>Multiple investigations have documented the <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/opioid-commission-argues-cannabis-legalization/">aggressive anti-cannabis lobbying</a> of the major pharmaceutical companies. Put simply, legal medical cannabis represents a <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/philadelphia-district-attorney-sues-big-pharma-opioid-crisis/">major threat to drug company profits</a> and their grip on the industry.</p>
<p>And Azar&#8217;s completely unfounded claim that there is no such thing as medical marijuana is a transparent indication of the conflicts of interest shaping federal drug policy and the government&#8217;s response to the opioid crisis.</p>
<h2>Former Big Pharma Lobbyist Turned Health Secretary Alex Azar Denies Existence Of Medical Marijuana</h2>
<p>So when Trump&#8217;s Health Secretary Alex Azar denies existence of medical marijuana, it&#8217;s not because he&#8217;s ignorant of the facts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because Azar is beholden to the special interests of Big Pharma, not the well-being of the American public.</p>

<p>California&#8217;s Bureau of Cannabis Control (BCC) has sent out more than 500 warning letters threatening legal action to unlicensed businesses. The letters were sent last week to retail dispensaries and delivery services who have not yet received licenses to operate under the state&#8217;s <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/california-releases-long-awaited-marijuana-regulations/">cannabis regulations</a> that went into effect on January 1. In the letters, California threatens hundreds of unlicensed cannabis businesses.</p>
<h2>A Formal Warning</h2>
<p>The letters, from Assistant Chief of Enforcement Paul Tupy, warn the businesses that the BCC believes they are participating in commercial <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> activity contrary to provisions of the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA). The letters also demand that <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/california-cracking-illegal-marijuana-businesses/">all such activity immediately cease</a>. Criminal and civil penalties are threatened if violations continue.</p>
<p>MAUCRSA was passed by the legislature in 2017 to reconcile differences in the state&#8217;s medical marijuana laws and Prop 64, which legalized marijuana for adult-use in California when it was passed by voters in 2016.</p>
<p>The BCC had previously indicated that enforcement of the new regulations would not begin immediately in 2018. But nearly two months into the new year, the agency and law enforcement have been receiving complaints about businesses who have not yet received licenses but are still operating. Many of those complaints&#160;are coming from the more than 3,000 companies who are operating legally after already completing the costly and laborious process of obtaining a license.</p>
<p>Natalia Thurston, a cannabis law attorney with a <a href="http://www.cbdpros.com/" rel="nofollow">practice</a> in Oakland, California, told&#160;<em>High Times</em> that one of her clients received warning emails from the BCC on February 14 and 20. The anonymous client operated a medical cannabis delivery service in the Bay Area but ceased operations January 1 when the new regulations went into effect.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Thurston noted that the emails did not indicate what her client has been accused of. &#8220;There was no evidence or specific factual information provided in the email notices regarding the activity alleged in the emails,&#8221; she said.</p>
<h2>Powerful Message</h2>
<p>It appears advertising by the targeted businesses may have instigated some of the warning&#160;letters. At a legislative hearing in Sacramento this week, Assemblymember Evan Low asked BCC Chair Lori Ajax about advertising appearing in a weekly newspaper. The ads, Low said, had missing or falsified license numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a complete disregard and gross negligence of the law,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>According to Ajax, her agency was already aware of the issue, mentioning the warnings that had been recently sent out.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are already dedicating a lot of our enforcement staff just on advertising because it is that important,&#8221;&#160;Ajax said. &#8220;It is prevalent, not just in Sacramento but across the state and it is jeopardizing the regulated market. We want to get this right.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Ajax also said the letters sent a &#8220;powerful message&#8221; to unlicensed commercial cannabis operators.</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;California Threatens Hundreds of Unlicensed Cannabis Businesses</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear how many businesses plan to heed the warnings. Attorney Thurston&#8217;s delivery service client won&#8217;t be back on the road until it obtains local and state licenses.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the text of the warning letter sent to hundreds of California cannabis businesses suspected of operating without a license.</p>

</div>
<p>The Bureau of Cannabis Control (Bureau) has reason to believe that you may be engaging in unlicensed commercial cannabis activity. Pursuant to the provisions of the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA), a valid state license from a state licensing authority is required to legally operate a commercial cannabis business within the State of California. If you are in fact engaging in unlicensed commercial cannabis activity, you must cease all commercial cannabis operations until you obtain a valid state license to avoid further violations of state law. Please be aware that such violations may result in criminal and administrative penalties, as well as civil penalties totaling up to three times the amount of the license fee for each violation.</p>
<p>To apply for a license, please visit the Bureau&#8217;s website,&#160;<a href="http://www.bcc.ca.gov/" rel="nofollow">www.bcc.ca.gov</a>, or contact the Bureau at (833) 768-5880.</p>

<p>The strange, suspenseful saga of &#8216;Operation Candy Crush&#8217; has ended after charges were dropped by prosecutors. Rutherford County, Tennessee District Jennings J. Jones announced the decision in a press release February 28. Jones has filed a motion with the court to dismiss all charges.</p>
<p>Operation Candy Crush received national news attention last month. Deputies from the Rutherford County Sherrif&#8217;s Office raided&#160;23 stores in the county on February 12. Deputies seized cash, gummy <a href="https://hightimes.com/edibles/best-edibles-2017/">candies</a>, and <a href="https://hightimes.com/products/best-portable-vaporizers-2017/">vape cartridges</a> containing the cannabinoid <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/cannabidiol-cbd/">CBD</a> in the raids. Officers padlocked the stores, and they remained closed for four days. The DA&#8217;s office had filed petitions to declare the businesses public nuisances and closed permanently.</p>
<p>Officials also charged 21 store owners with felony drug selling charges. Jones dropped the charges after labs at the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) reported that they could not determine the source of the CBD. The DA ended the actions against the stores, as well.</p>
<h2>Is It Hemp? Or Marijuana?</h2>
<p>&#8220;Chemists from the TBI have now informed my office that they cannot determine whether the cannabidiol detected on these products came from a hemp plant or marijuana plant,&#8221; the release said.</p>
<p>&#8220;TBI is no longer willing to testify that this is a Schedule VI substance. We have no choice but to dismiss,&#8221; Jones <a href="http://www.dnj.com/story/news/crime/2018/02/28/operation-candy-crush-charges-dropped-cbd-raid-industrial-hemp/372793002/" rel="nofollow">told local media</a>.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

		</div>

<p>Originally, Jones expressed great confidence in the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you possess this without a prescription, you have broken the law,&#8221; Jones said at a press conference after the raids.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are selling this without a prescription or if you&#8217;re not a pharmacy selling it to someone with a prescription for it, you have broken the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farmers can legally grow hemp in Tennessee under a state pilot program.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

		</div>

<h2>Insult to Injury</h2>
<p>In another twist in the case, authorities could be held responsible for losses at one of the stores. A thief broke into the Last Stop Market during the time it was under order to remain closed.</p>
<p>Store clerk Jacklyn Ryder <a href="http://wkrn.com/2018/02/26/rutherford-county-store-raided-in-operation-candy-crush-broken-into-while-padlocked/" rel="nofollow">told a local TV news station</a> she was working when the store was raided. Deputies denied her request to set the store&#8217;s alarm before they left, she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our store was left unalarmed for four days while we were closed down because of this,&#8221; said Ryder.</p>
<p>The thief&#160;stole more than $600 from a change machine and some beer. The burglar pried open the store&#8217;s back door to gain entry. The door received extensive damage in the break-in. She said the store&#8217;s owner may file suit, a sentiment she agrees with.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel not only him. I feel like every store that suffered should file a lawsuit because they have families too,&#8221; Ryder said. &#8220;I went four days, that&#8217;s about $400 out of my check that I don&#8217;t have because of some allegation that&#8217;s not true.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;The Strange, Suspenseful Saga of &#8216;Operation Candy Crush&#8217; Has Ended</h2>
<p>Other store owners say that they are also planning a civil suit in response to the raids and store closures. Throughout their ordeal, the businesspeople had stuck together, pledging not to plea bargain.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has caused an enormous cost to all the store owners,&#8221; store owner Stacey Hamilton said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll apologize in nearly as public a way as they condemned us as drug dealers.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

					<p>A prominent Democratic U.S. senator is slamming pharmaceutical companies for opposing marijuana legalization.<span id="more-69778"></span></p>
<p>&#8220;To them it&#8217;s competition for chronic pain, and that&#8217;s outrageous because we don&#8217;t have the crisis in people who take marijuana for chronic pain having overdose issues,&#8221; Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not the same thing. It&#8217;s not as highly addictive as opioids are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the federal level, we really need to say it is a legal drug you can access if you need it,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Gillibrand, in an appearance on Good Day New York on Friday morning, was responding to a question about whether marijuana is a &#8220;gateway drug&#8221; that leads people to try more dangerous substances.</p>

											    	<h4>When the lack-of-weed blues gets you down, swiftly make your way back to a state where cannabis is legal.</h4>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you should bring your vape pen on the plane,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><em>Fine, I will respect your wishes and not get your sober self into trouble with TSA for carrying hash oil,</em> I thought to myself. Already reticent about a weekend away on someone else&#8217;s accord, I wasn&#8217;t sure if this trip was a good move.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; my boss mentioned, &#8220;You will love it; there are <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/hippie-time-flower-power-quiz/" data-wpel-link="internal">hippies</a> in Austin, Texas.&#8221;</p>
<h4>Where there are hippies, there&#8217;s weed?</h4>
<p>The parental unit will provide the stash, he tried to soothe me. &#8220;Like the jar they gave me for Christmas?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;They used to grow better weed when I was a kid.&#8221; Oh, nostalgia. I took his word for it.</p>
<h4>Here&#8217;s ten ways quality weed would have elevated my weekend in Texas:</h4>
<ul>
<li>I would have consumed a heavy Indica and snoozed through the red-eye flight to <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/texas-compassionate-use-act-cbd/" data-wpel-link="internal">Austin</a>.</li>
<li>Early that morning when we rolled in, a Sativa would have propelled me on the drive to visit the parents in San Antonio.</li>
<li>Cannabis tea would have aided me in digesting an accidental gluten intake.</li>
<li>When stuck in the apartment with my feverish child, I would have thought of some clever way of getting to know Austin without having to leave the pad. I could have brought Austin to me by smoking with the neighbors and getting to know the locals.</li>
<li>Had I been high at the wedding, I would have schmoozed with the wedding guests and likely convinced a local politician to <a href="http://www.dallasobserver.com/news/texas-marijuana-laws-in-2018-and-beyond-10201247" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">legalize it</a>.</li>
<li>I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten a headache from mixing tequila and red wine. Instead, I would have gotten the munchies from mixing Indica and Sativa.</li>
<li>The spelunking would have been even more DOPE!</li>
<li>Cannabis-infused southern sweet tea, that is all.</li>
<li>Instead of bawling my eyes out to him in the hot tub, we would have had stoned sexy times under a full moon.</li>
<li>I would have blown smoke at the bugs preventing them from attacking my shoulder.</li>
</ul>
<p>But cannabis is <a href="https://www.mpp.org/states/texas/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">not legal</a> in the state of <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/12/18/texas-medical-marijuana-law-rules/94818/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Texas</a>. And year-old pre-crumbled <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/kelly-guava-jelly-hippie-musings/" data-wpel-link="internal">hippie</a> weed from eastern Washington just didn&#8217;t cut it for me.</p>
<p>Vacations are better with your best friend Mary Jane. With weed as the herb of your life, you can always find the right blend to get the sensation right.</p>

<h4>Vape Cartridges by Pride Wellness</h4>
<p>Pride Cannabis is now Pride Wellness&#8212;the same products you love, just with a more fitting name. For the owners, the name change was a no-brainer. &#8220;Our company is a wellness company; it makes more sense,&#8221; explains Co-Owner Buck Angel. &#8220;It&#8217;s very important that people understand why we started Pride Wellness. We realize our community does suffer from a lot of abuse of drugs and alcohol, as well as anxiety. Nobody is really targeting our community for wellness with cannabis. That&#8217;s why we started it&#8212;to really help people to understand they can use alternative medication like cannabis, instead of pharmaceuticals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sugar&#8221; Sean O&#8217;Malley made his much-anticipated&#160;debut at UFC 222 on Saturday night, and despite an impressive victory, his exploits in the octagon weren&#8217;t the only highlights of the night. One of the more noteworthy moments of the 23-year-old&#8217;s night actually came after the much-anticipated event, when O&#8217;Malley got the chance to show off his custom new weed strain at the UFC 222 after-party.</p>
<h2>Sean O&#8217;Malley&#8217;s Strain</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s no coincidence that Sean O&#8217;Malley happens to <a href="https://hightimes.com/business/snoop-dogg-joins-cannabis-lab-testing-game/">Snoop Dogg&#8217;s</a> favorite new fighter.</p>
<p>The fighter first made a name for himself back in July with a one-punch knockout of&#160;Alfred Khashakyan on &#8220;Dana White&#8217;s Tuesday Night Contender Series.&#8221;</p>
<p>He later celebrated by<a href="http://www.tmz.com/2017/07/21/snoop-dogg-ufc-sean-omalley/" rel="nofollow"> smoking up with Snoop</a>.</p>
<p>Fast forward eight months and the fighter is now making waves in both the UFC and amongst the <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> community.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Despite injuring his foot in the third round of his debut fight with fellow bantamweight&#160;Andre Soukhamthath, O&#8217;Malley managed to cruise to a victory with a dominating performance.</p>
<p>Following the gutsy win, the now-undefeated fighter used some of his own herbal remedies to facilitate a recovery.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Malley was, unsurprisingly, seen toking up through a&#160;golden glove spliff some time after the event, with what we presume to be the strain he said he would debut following the contest.</p>
<p>The customized bud is, according to O&#8217;Malley, a hybrid between Lemonhead and OG92.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re releasing the new strain, Suga Show OG,&#8221; O&#8217;Malley said in an interview with&#160;<a href="http://www.tmz.com/2018/03/01/sean-omalley-custom-weed-strain-ufc-222-sugar-show/" rel="nofollow">TMZ Sports</a>&#160;earlier in the week.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mix between Lemonhead and OG 92. I think they&#8217;re going to bring a good amount of that. They&#8217;re gonna have dab rigs set up. We&#8217;re gonna have a juice bar. The ultimate recovery: Smoking some weed and drinking some veggies.&#8221;</p>
<p>While UFC president Dana White confirmed Saturday night that O&#8217;Malley did not suffer a broken foot in his contest, there&#8217;s no doubt Suga Show OG won&#8217;t help it&#8217;s creator throughout the recovery process, nonetheless.</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;Sean O&#8217;Malley Shows Off His New Weed Strain At UFC 222 After-Party</h2>
<p>While some might be surprised at the young gun&#8217;s willingness to show off his toking habits in his first professional fight, it shouldn&#8217;t come as that much of a shock to those who closely follow the UFC.</p>
<p>The UFC remains one of the more progressive sporting leagues when it comes to smoking weed, as it essentially allows its players to smoke&#8212;as long as it&#8217;s not right before a fight.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, we&#8217;ve seen it&#8217;s biggest star, <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/ufc-champion-conor-mcgregor-spotted-amsterdam-weed-cafe/">Conor McGregor, checking out an Amsterdam dispensary in plain sight</a>.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentC -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc article_middleContentC dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>More telling, however, has been the <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/nate-diaz-sparks-joint-on-live-tv/">Diaz brothers</a> and their lust for cannabis. A few weeks back, we saw Nate Diaz smoke a joint on live television.</p>
<p>Although the younger Diaz brother has been suspended for his weed usage in the past, it appears&#160;he could be eyeing a comeback. With today&#8217;s lax rules, we could see him in the octagon sooner, rather than later.</p>
<p>After all, it&#8217;s not like his older brother, Nick, has been secretive <a href="https://hightimes.com/sports/high-times-interview-nick-diaz/">about his own cannabis usage</a>, either.</p>

INSERT INTO articles VALUES (12688, 'Product Review: IndigoPro Oil Vape Pen', NULL, 'indigo-pro-3-1280x800.jpg', '<div class="uncode_text_column"><p>There is a wide variety of different cartridges out there and <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/the-past-present-and-future-of-cannabis-oil-vaporizer-cartridges">the technology continues to change</a>, but to my knowledge no cartridge I&#8217;ve ever owned has vibrated in my mouth&#8212;until now. When I grab a vape pen and hold it to my lips and it goes off like a Sonicare possessed, I&#8217;m forced to ask myself, &#8220;Is this enhancing my cannabis consuming experience?&#8221; And if so, why?<br>

<p>To find out, I recently put the <a href="https://www.leafly.com/brands/indigopro">IndigoPro&#8217;s Advanced Vapor System</a> to the test. This new proprietary cartridge system boasts three times the vapor&#8230;but does that mean it goes through oil three times as fast?</p>
<h2>The IndigoPro at a Glance</h2>
<figure id="attachment_59286" style="width: 840px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-59286 size-large" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090334/indigo-pro-2-1024x640.jpg" alt="IndigoPro weed oil vape pen box contents" width="840" height="525" srcset="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090334/indigo-pro-2-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090334/indigo-pro-2-300x188.jpg 300w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090334/indigo-pro-2-768x480.jpg 768w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090334/indigo-pro-2-50x31.jpg 50w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090334/indigo-pro-2-1280x800.jpg 1280w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090334/indigo-pro-2-960x600.jpg 960w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090334/indigo-pro-2-480x300.jpg 480w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090334/indigo-pro-2-240x150.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(Julia Sumpter/Leafly)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The IndigoPro includes a minimalist carrying case with a foam cutout for the battery and a library of IndigoPro cartridges. Its battery is 320mAh, which is about 40mAh higher than standard variable voltage batteries. (Think of milliampere hours, or mAh, as the size of your battery&#8217;s fuel tank.) The unit comes in indigo (naturally) and graphite colors, and has a beautiful octagonal finish that is sleek and buttonless.</p>

<p>Included with the case is a micro-USB charging cable to get you up and running. There isn&#8217;t a logical place to put this cord in the provided case, which seems like a missed opportunity, but IndigoPro still has a few design tricks up its sleeve.</p>
<h2>What Does the IndigoPro Do Well?</h2>

<p>After getting acquainted with the IndigoPro, I&#8217;ve come to appreciate some a few aspects of its design and functionality.</p>
<h3>Heavy Hits</h3>
<p>The IndigoPro&#8217;s draws are airy but firm, accompanied by the aforementioned mouth vibration. I don&#8217;t know whether or not it&#8217;s three times the vapor, but I find myself coughing more because the hits are so large. These voluminous hits definitely get me lifted.</p>
<h3>Impressive, Function-Forward Tech</h3>
<p>While the high is the part of the cannabis-consuming experience that stays with you, the technology powering the IndigoPro experience shines as well. Its use of USB charging, for example, is a must for all future vaporizers&#8212;USB technology is so ubiquitous nowadays, it&#8217;s practically a no-brainer when designing a highly functional, easy-to-use vape pen.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/science-tech/fascinating-uses-of-technology-in-cannabis-industry"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/03094230/technology-cannabis-industry-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">4 Fascinating Uses of Technology in the Cannabis Industry</div></div></a></div>
<p>Another unique technical feature is how the unit&#8217;s vibration is used as a battery indicator. While the vibration may seem like a bit of a novelty, embedding functional elements like this shows some design foresight&#8212;removing buttons eliminates the anxiety of accidentally turning on the vape pen in a pocket or depressing a button and cooking the cart oil off while walking or sitting down. It&#8217;s an aesthetic win as well, keeping all the solid lines on the body of the unit intact to give the battery its sleek, clean exterior.</p>
<h3>Simple Cartridge Design</h3>
<p>Speaking of design, IndigoPro&#8217;s cartridges are conveniently color-coded to help jog a consumer&#8217;s memory, but this method can get challenging the more a person buys into the IndigoPro Advanced Vapor System. For example, if I&#8217;m an indica-only type of dude and have all purple-tipped carts, how do I figure out which strain is which? This hurdle aside, the coloration is beautiful and representative, which can be a guide post for the average consumer.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/sativa-indica-and-hybrid-differences-between-cannabis-types"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/26114231/Sativa-vs-Indica-Header-1-480x300.png"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Sativa vs. Indica vs. Hybrid: What&#8217;s the Difference Between Cannabis Types?</div></div></a></div>
<p>Unfortunately, cartridge availability is a bit of an issue depending on the market you&#8217;re in. IndigoPro&#8217;s CO2 cartridges with natural, cannabis-derived <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/terpenes-the-flavors-of-cannabis-aromatherapy">terpenes</a> are available in some locations, but not in Seattle (where I live). It&#8217;s a bummer that these cartridges are out of reach in my area,&#160; but I am glad to hear that consumers have choices within IndigoPro&#8217;s proprietary cartridge ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Where Could the IndigoPro Improve?</h2>
<figure id="attachment_59287" style="width: 840px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-59287 size-large" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090343/indigo-pro-4-1024x640.jpg" alt="IndigoPro weed oil vape pen battery" width="840" height="525" srcset="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090343/indigo-pro-4-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090343/indigo-pro-4-300x188.jpg 300w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090343/indigo-pro-4-768x480.jpg 768w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090343/indigo-pro-4-50x31.jpg 50w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090343/indigo-pro-4-1280x800.jpg 1280w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090343/indigo-pro-4-960x600.jpg 960w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090343/indigo-pro-4-480x300.jpg 480w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090343/indigo-pro-4-240x150.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(Julia Sumpter/Leafly)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As slick as the IndigoPro is from a design and tech perspective, there are some areas of improvement.</p>
<h3>Proprietary Cartridges Can Be Too Limiting</h3>
<p>The pen uses a proprietary magnetized cartridge that does not fit with any other vape pen. While IndigoPro boasts &#8220;magnetic, leak-resistant ceramic cartridges,&#8221; I&#8217;m frustrated by the technical limitations just so the cart can vibrate and magnetically attach to the battery. These design flourishes look and feel good the first couple of times using the unit, but the novelty does not outweigh its limitation.</p>
<h3>No Cartridge Labeling</h3>
<p>As I mentioned, another frustrating drawback is the lack of labeling on the cartridges. This problem has only recently been addressed by <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/pax-era-portable-cannabis-oil-vaporizer-review">Pax and its Pax Pods</a>, but as a cartridge consumer with carts for different occasions, labeling is almost priceless.</p>

<h3>Potential Vapor Waste</h3>
<p>IndigoPro cartridges are as expensive, if not more expensive, than your standard cart, and it&#8217;s nice that they create a lot of vapor, but from a consumer standpoint, that could also mean a lot of waste. Even with a standard vape cartridge, I&#8217;m not holding each hit so long that I exhale nothing. With each hit I leisurely exhale the vapor (and <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/cannabinoids-101-what-makes-cannabis-medicine">cannabinoids</a>) that didn&#8217;t get absorbed in my lungs. Force-feeding a bunch of vapor into someone&#8217;s lungs might please consumers looking for fat clouds, but it doesn&#8217;t make a dollar&#8217;s worth of cents to go puffing cannabinoids you&#8217;re inevitably wasting.</p>
<h3>Flavor Concerns</h3>
<p>While the the cartridges have a fancy design and novel function, the contents of the cartridge is really where the story&#8217;s at. <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/science-tech/what-are-cannabis-distillate-concentrates">Distillate</a>, as many cannabis consumers know, is a potent, mostly flavorless concentration of a strain&#8217;s primary cannabinoids. Because distillate is almost entirely flavorless, many companies see this as a blank slate to create new and intriguing flavors through the introduction of botanical oils that don&#8217;t originate from the cannabis plant.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/science-tech/what-are-cannabis-distillate-concentrates"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/30143132/cannabis-distillate-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Cannabis Oil Distillate: A Different Kind of Concentrate</div></div></a></div>
<p>While some consumers don&#8217;t mind the artificial taste of these botanical elements and are just stoked on the high-octane punch of distillate, consumers like myself can find the flavor to be off-putting. These distillates are also sold as strain-specific, even though they contain little to no cannabis-derived terpenes that truly define a strain&#8217;s flavor, effects, and overall uniqueness.</p>
<h2>Who Is the IndigoPro For?</h2>
<p>In my opinion, the IndigoPro is for heavy-hitting vape consumers looking for massive pulls of potent concentrate. If you&#8217;re not a big fan of the way cannabis tastes and you&#8217;d rather have a flavor-injected experience with sugar plum, blackberry, or whatever your preferred characteristic may be, the IndigoPro might be right up your alley.</p>
<p>Truth be told, the IndigoPro isn&#8217;t the device for me. The mouth vibrations and magnetic mouthpieces just weren&#8217;t enough for me to invest in a whole new cartridge ecosystem. Other consumers might have different feelings, however, and I encourage them to share their opinion&#8212;what do you think about the IndigoPro?</p>

<div class="leafly-pull-quote">On some shows, cannabis isn&#8217;t merely an accessory, but a device that kicks the plot&#8217;s gears into motion.</div>
<p>For decades, the plant has enjoyed winking cameos in film and TV. Before <em>Weeds</em>, <em>Broad City</em> and <em>High Maintenance</em>, films like <em>Easy Rider</em> glorified the mind-expanding effects of cannabis, while Cheech &amp; Chong pioneered new strains of stoner humor.</p>
<p>Today, it&#8217;s often granted a starring role: when Abbi or Ilana light up yet another <a href="http://www.thecannabist.co/2016/03/17/broad-city-weed-ilana-glazer-abbi-jacobson/50292/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fake blunt</a> on camera, the herb isn&#8217;t serving as a mere accessory, but as a device that kicks the plot&#8217;s gears into motion.</p>
<h2>Let the Ideas Flow</h2>
<p>Cannabis has a long-honored place behind the camera as well. Hollywood traditionally maintains a hands-off approach towards its cannabis-friendly creatives: In 2014, <a href="http://drugs.gawker.com/8-big-media-companies-that-still-drug-test-their-employ-1599105435" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gawker discovered</a> that 17 media companies drug-tested their employees&#8212;including Gannett, Hearst, The Washington Post and the New York Times&#8212;but testing is almost nonexistent within the creative ranks of TV shows and films. According to one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/4sdrlo/employees_of_large_entertainment_companies_nbc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anonymous Reddit thread</a>, you can spend an entire career hopping from studio to studio without ever having to pee into a cup, even at Disney.</p>
<p>The one exception is in reality TV, where &#8220;personalities&#8221; are often tested during the casting process. &#8221;If it&#8217;s weed, we don&#8217;t care,&#8221; says Jeffrey Marx, a reality TV casting associate. &#8220;We just check because we want to know what to expect while we&#8217;re filming.&#8221;</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">''I&#8217;ve never been tested,'' one former showrunner told Leafly. ''Why would employers try to stop something that aids in creativity and makes them money?''</div>
<p>A few years ago, when Leonardo DiCaprio showed up at awards ceremonies with a vape pen, it was taken as a bold, if not shocking, move. Now vape pens are ubiquitous at award shows and other industry events. Sarah Silverman showed hers off at the Emmys a few years back and <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-sarah-silverman-pot-vape-pen-emmy-awards-red-carpet-20140826-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no one batted an eye.&#160; </a></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been tested,&#8221; one former showrunner, who wished to remain anonymous, told Leafly. &#8220;Why would employers try to stop something that aids in creativity and makes them money?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the 1990s, the showrunner added, her employers held an even more permissive view of the drug. &#8220;I used to openly smoke in my office and sometimes in after-hour creative sessions. I remember one meeting for a TV special where nothing was happening so I pulled out a joint. Nobody cared.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as the studios she worked for were gobbled up by international corporations&#8212;and came within the purview of mainstream HR departments&#8212;the laissez-faire attitudes diminished. &#8220;Everyone became more uptight,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Ironically, though, not about sexual misconduct.&#8221;</p>

<h2>The Writers Prefer Sativas</h2>
<p>Guy Branum, a story editor on <em>The Mindy Project</em> and host of <em>Talk Show The Game Show</em>, told Leafly that most shows don&#8217;t care who vapes during breaks. The atmosphere, of course, depends heavily on the discretion of showrunners, studios and networks. One critically acclaimed show, Branum added, is known to share a bong in the writers&#8217; room.</p>
<p>As for strains, Branum says that any energizing, creative sativa is a favorite among his crew. Indicas, he added, were strictly for &#8220;open mic&#8217;ers with no jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not everyone in the industry has enjoyed the fruits of marijuana&#8217;s growing acceptance. Another writer, who wished to remain anonymous, said the idea of smoking in a writer&#8217;s room on his show is a nonstarter. &#8220;I feel like people realized that didn&#8217;t work in the seventies. I don&#8217;t even know if stoned ideas are very good, to be honest.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Coming Out as Consumers and Creators</h2>
<p><a href="http://cherylshuman.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheryl Shuman</a>, founder of the Beverly Hills Cannabis Club, has been organizing events for Hollywood stoners since the early nineties. She told Leafly that industry players have become increasingly comfortable coming out of the &#8220;green closet.&#8221;</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">Back in the 1990s, some cannabis-consuming actors working on the same set wouldn''t dare talk about it with each other.</div>
<p>&#8220;When I first got involved with legalization in the late nineties, I received calls from very famous people and they&#8217;d say, &#8216;I&#8217;ve been a closet smoker for so long; can you help me get legal and teach me how to have my own little garden in the backyard?&#8217; Some of these people were actors working on the same movie set together but wouldn&#8217;t dare talk about it with their co-stars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shuman, who refers to herself as &#8216;the Martha Stewart of marijuana,&#8217; happily offered her assistance. She began throwing speakeasy parties and passing out samples of different strains to her friends. &#8220;Around 1996 and 1997, we&#8217;d bring fresh product down and I&#8217;d have almost a thousand people over. We did yoga retreats and we&#8217;d fly people up to where I grew pot. Nobody knows this stuff. I can tell it now; back then, I couldn&#8217;t tell anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miriam Hess, who works as an animation writer, says she&#8217;s surprised more of her coworkers don&#8217;t partake in the stuff. &#8220;The animation world is more corporate and a lot of times people don&#8217;t want to talk about it openly,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Then again, many of my coworkers are sharp-tongued and brazen, so maybe they don&#8217;t need the weed. Maybe it slows them down, in a way, because some of them have this manic thing going on, which is kind of the stereotype of the L.A. male Hollywood writer.&#8221;</p>

<p>More than 350 patients involved in the study initially reported using opioid painkillers. Nearly 63 percent reported reduced or eliminated opioid usage after six months of using medical cannabis.</p>
<p>Officials believe the results are encouraging, but say more research is necessary.</p>
<p>About 10 percent of patients reported no benefit, while as much as 40 percent experienced mild side effects such as fogginess or fatigue.</p>

The result is the slow decline of pre-employment drug tests, which for decades had been a requirement for new recruits in industries ranging from manufacturing to finance.</p>
<p>As of the beginning of 2018, Excellence Health Inc., a Las Vegas-based health care company with around 6,000 employees, no longer drug tests people coming to work for the pharmaceutical side of the business. The company stopped testing for marijuana two years ago. &#8220;We don&#8217;t care what people do in their free time,&#8221; said Liam Meyer, a company spokesperson. &#8220;We want to help these people, instead of saying: &#8216;Hey, you can&#8217;t work for us because you used a substance,''&#8221; he added. The company also added a hotline for any workers who might be struggling with drug use.&#8217;</p>
<p>Last month, AutoNation Inc., the largest U.S. auto dealer, <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/29/auto-nation-marijuana-test-hiring-policy/97765/">announced it would no longer refuse job applicants who tested positive for weed</a>. The Denver Post, owned by Digital First Media, ended pre-employment drug testing for all non-safety sensitive positions in September 2016.</p>
<p>So far, companies in states that have legalized either recreational or medicinal marijuana are leading the way on dropping drug tests. A survey last year by the Mountain States Employers Council of 609 Colorado employers found that the share of companies testing for marijuana use fell to 66 percent, down from 77 percent the year before.</p>

<hr>
<p>Drug testing <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/07/31/drug-test-marijuana-workers/84887/">restricts the job pool</a>, and in the current tight labor market, that&#8217;s having an impact on productivity and growth.</p>
<p>In surveys done by the Federal Reserve last year, employers cited an inability by applicants to pass drug tests among reasons for difficulties in hiring. Failed tests reached an all-time high in 2017, according to data from Quest Diagnostics Inc.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s likely to get worse as more people partake in state-legalized cannabis.</p>
<p>&#8220;The benefits of at least reconsidering the drug policy on behalf of an employer would be pretty high,&#8221; said Jeremy Kidd, a professor at Mercer Law School, who wrote a paper on the economics of workplace drug testing. &#8220;A blanket prohibition can&#8217;t possibly be the most economically efficient policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Companies are having a hard enough time hiring, with unemployment hovering around 4 percent. &#8220;Employers are really strapped and saying &#8216;We&#8217;re going to forgive certain things,''&#8221; said James Reidy, a lawyer that works with employers on their human resources policies. Reidy knows of a half-dozen other large employers that have quietly changed their policies in recent years. Not all companies want to advertise the change, fearing it might imply they are soft on drugs. (Even former FBI director James Comey in 2014 <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2014/06/02/should-getting-high-stop-you-from-getting-hired/12910/">half-joked about the need for the bureau to re-evaluate its drug-testing policy</a> to attract the best candidates.)</p>

<p>Why the change? Pre-employment testing is no longer worth the expense in a society increasingly accepting of drug use. A Gallup poll in October found that <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/10/25/gallup-poll-marijuana-legalization-americans/90851/">64 percent of Americans favor legalization</a>. That&#8217;s the most since the company first started asking the question in 1969, when only 12 percent supported changing the plant&#8217;s status. Drug tests costs from $30 to $50 a pop, but the potential costs to an employer are far greater than the actual test.</p>
<p>In addition to helping ease the labor market, eliminating drug testing could have even broader benefits for the economy, said Kidd. Employers could hire the best, theoretically most-productive workers, he said, instead of rejecting people based on their recreational habits. Companies have said they lose out to foreign competitors because they can&#8217;t find people who can pass drugs tests, a particularly acute problem in the areas most affected by the opioid crisis.</p>
<p>Some jobs, such as those involving the use of heavy machinery, will always require drug tests. Excellence Health still drug-tests any employee working on a government contract, even in states where weed is legal. Companies are also reserving the right to test after an accident or if an employee comes to work notably impaired.</p>
<p>Not all companies are ready to change course. Restaurant Brands International Inc., which owns Burger King, hasn&#8217;t altered its corporate marijuana policy, said Chief Executive Officer Daniel Schwartz. Ford Motor Co. still treats pot as an illegal substance, according to a company spokeswoman.</p>
<p>Weed-averse employers have a notable ally: <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/tag/jeff-sessions/">Attorney General Jeff Sessions</a>. A longtime opponent of legalization, Sessions <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/04/jeff-sessions-rescinding-legalized-marijuana-policy/95875/">rescinded in January</a> the Obama-era policies that enabled state-legalized cannabis industries to flourish. The <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/04/sessions-cole-memo-marijuana-legal-impact/95903/">uncertainty</a> caused by the Justice Department&#8217;s actions may discourage companies from making changes.</p>
<p>Employers can also get discounts on workers&#8217; compensation insurance for maintaining a &#8220;drug-free workplace&#8221; by, in part, drug-testing workers. But the types of workplaces forgoing pre-employment tests already enjoy relatively small savings. A job in an office setting, for example, won&#8217;t have very many workers&#8217; compensation claims, compared to a factory. The money saved by meeting the qualifications for a drug-free zone isn&#8217;t worth it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We assume that a certain level of employees are going to be partaking on the weekends,&#8221; said Reidy, the employment lawyer. &#8220;We don&#8217;t care. We&#8217;re going to exclude a whole group of people, and we desperately need workers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just hours after<a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/04/jeff-sessions-rescinding-legalized-marijuana-policy/95875/"> U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on Jan. 4 </a>that federal prosecutors would be free to crack down on marijuana operations as they see fit, Jesse Arreguin, the mayor in Berkeley, California, summoned city councilman Ben Bartlett to his office with a novel idea.</p>
<p>Berkeley was already the first city in the nation to formally declare itself a sanctuary city on immigration, barring city officials from cooperating with federal authorities. Why not do the same thing with marijuana? <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/02/14/marijuana-sanctuary-city-berkeley-sessions/99022/">Last month, it did</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew we had to do something,&#8221; Bartlett said. &#8220;This is a new engine of a healthy economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others may soon follow Berkeley&#8217;s lead: Alaska, California and Massachusetts lawmakers are among those with similar bills pending, though the chances for passage is unclear.</p>
<p>Alaska state Rep. Adam Wool, who owns a movie, restaurant and concert venue with a liquor license in <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/tag/fairbanks/">Fairbanks</a>, said he introduced his bill as both a statement and a precaution.</p>
<div class="large-6 medium-12 small-12 columns right sidebox related"><hr><h4>Related stories</h4><ul><li><a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/03/02/alaska-marijuana-taxes-january/100332/" rel="bookmark" title="Alaska marijuana tax collections hit new high in January">Alaska marijuana tax collections hit new high in January</a></li><li><a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/02/02/alaska-marijuana-tax-collections-tumble/98143/" rel="bookmark" title="Marijuana sales in Alaska drop for second month in a row">Marijuana sales in Alaska drop for second month in a row</a></li><li><a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/03/alaska-marijuana-sales-november/95817/" rel="bookmark" title="Alaska&#8217;s marijuana sales were down in November">Alaska&#8217;s marijuana sales were down in November</a></li></ul><hr></div>
<p>&#8220;If the federal government wants to prosecute someone for breaking federal law, I guess they have every right to do that,&#8221; said Wool, a Democrat from one of Alaska&#8217;s major marijuana-growing areas.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just saying, we will have no obligation to assist them.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/04/jeff-sessions-rescinding-legalized-marijuana-policy/95875/">Sessions&#8217; announcement</a> invalidated a 2013 policy that allowed for legalized marijuana to flourish by limiting federal enforcement of the drug, as long as states prevented it from getting to places it was outlawed and kept it from gangs and children. His action also <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/04/sessions-cole-memo-marijuana-legal-impact/95903/">unsettled the industry</a> and spooked potential marijuana industry investors. Marijuana is still illegal under federal law.</p>
<p>Casey O&#8217;Neill remembers helicopter enforcement raids of grow sites in California when he was growing up in the 1980s. It was then that his parents, carpenters who grew small amounts of cannabis, became school teachers, he said.</p>
<p>He now helps run a farm that produces vegetables and marijuana for medical use near Laytonville, </p>
<p>California, and is glad lawmakers are looking at ways to push back against the federal government.</p>
<p>Over the years, enforcement &#8220;has been uneven, we&#8217;ll say, and that&#8217;s kind of one of the things about it. It just means that everybody&#8217;s always afraid, and that&#8217;s hard,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Dale Gieringer, director of California NORML, a marijuana advocacy group, said California has a lousy history with the federal government on marijuana enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the feds care too much about marijuana in Alaska, to tell you the truth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But marijuana has been a big industry in this state, so we&#8217;re sort of on the front lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no apparent panic in the industry over Sessions&#8217; change in policy, given limited federal resources and prosecutors having had <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/05/prosecutors-pot-friendly-states-will-decide-crackdown/96164/">discretion in bringing cases all along</a>. But there isn&#8217;t complacency, either.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the federal government is going to effectively step in and wipe us out of business. </p>
<p>I just find that hard to believe at this point. But they can make it hard for us,&#8221; said Jennifer Canfield, who co-owns a state-licensed marijuana cultivation operation and retail store in Alaska&#8217;s capital city, Juneau.</p>
<p>Peter Mlynarik, police chief in Soldotna, Alaska, called the Alaska bill a terrible idea. He asked what would happen if a local agency were helping the federal government on a heroin bust but also found marijuana in the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s crazy to put that burden on, especially, police officers that are supposed to obey federal laws,&#8221; said Mlynarik, who <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/05/alaska-marijuana-control-board-mlynarik-sessions/96068/">resigned from Alaska&#8217;s marijuana regulatory board</a> after Sessions&#8217; actions in January, saying it stripped the underpinning for the state&#8217;s legal marijuana industry.</p>
<p>Morgan Fox, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, said he can&#8217;t see federal agents raiding businesses that are complying with state law.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t put it past them,&#8221; he said, adding that <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/02/05/sessions-marijuana-cole-memo-us-attorney/97703/">new U.S. attorneys have been appointed by President Donald Trump in many states</a>. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t put it past at least a few of them to want to gain points with their boss. But I think, politically, it would be a disaster for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Massachusetts&#8217; sanctuary-style bill was prompted by comments from that state&#8217;s U.S. attorney, Andrew Lelling, who <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/08/massachusetts-marijuana-law-prosecution-andrew-lelling/96249/">declined to rule out prosecuting commercial marijuana businesses</a> that are legal under state law. He later said his priority would be <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/24/massachusetts-marijuana-us-attorney-andrew-lelling/97474/">prosecuting opioid crimes, not marijuana</a>.</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam declined comment on the pending bills.</p>

<div id="leafly-dfp-ad-widget-mobile-medium-rectangle-281816461" class="leafly-dfp-ad-container">    </div>
<p>The conviction came after Michael Kimbrew, 44, pleaded not guilty in federal court last year to one count each of attempted extortion and bribery of a public official.</p>

<p>A jury returned the verdicts on both charges after six hours of deliberation.</p>
<p>Kimbrew did not take the witness stand in his defense. He could face up to 18 years in prison when he&#8217;s sentenced June 4.</p>
<p>Kimbrew &#8220;left a pretty damning trail,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney Lindsey Greer Dotson told jurors.</p>
<p>He was working in the Compton field office of Rep. Janice Hahn in 2015 when he approached a marijuana shop that was operating illegally and told an employee it would be shut down if he couldn&#8217;t reach a deal with the owners, according to prosecutors.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/irs-agent-sentenced-to-2-12-years-for-20k-bribe-from-cannabis-com"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/23203229/irs-agent-sentenced-to-2-12-years-for-20k-bribe-from-cannabis-com-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">IRS Agent Sentenced to 2 1/2 Years for $20K Bribe From Cannabis Company</div></div></a></div>
<p>Kimbrew then met with the owners at Compton City Hall, where Hahn had a district office. He told them he was working with state and federal agencies, including the FBI, and for $5,000 could &#8220;make things happen&#8221; to get the proper medical marijuana permits, an indictment states.</p>
<p>Kimbrew had no authority over marijuana shops, which were illegal in the city at the time, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Kimbrew later met at City Hall with an FBI agent who was posing as the owners&#8217; business partner.</p>
<p>Jurors watched a video of Kimbrew sitting down with an undercover agent and discussing the bribe, which the agent had hidden in a restaurant menu and passed to the defendant during a second meeting, the indictment says.</p>
<p>Hahn, who is now a Los Angeles County supervisor, was not named in the indictment.</p>

<p>Visitors to Las Vegas have a new way to help keep them out of trouble, as the local airport sets up amnesty boxes for flyers to dispose their <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">weed</a> or other recreational or prescription drugs, giving new meaning to the adage &#8220;what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. &#8221;</p>
<h2>The Boxes</h2>
<p>The bright green boxes were installed February 16 at McCarran International Airport as a way for travelers to safely get rid of cannabis or other items that might not be allowed&#160;through Transportation Security Authority checkpoints. Recreational cannabis sales were legalized in the state of <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/nevada-marijuana-sales-soar-august/">Nevada</a> on July 1, 2017, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s legal everywhere.</p>
<p>In October of last year, Clark County, home to Sin City, passed an ordinance outlawing possession of cannabis, marijuana, and THC on&#160; McCarran grounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marijuana is prohibited on airport property,&#8221; said airport spokesperson Christine Crews in an <a href="http://www.lasvegasnow.com/news/mccarran-airports-amnesty-boxes-allows-travelers-to-discard-illegal-drugs-before-flying/987564126" rel="nofollow">interview with local media</a>.&#160;&#8220;You could face a citation fine, or you could face arrest depending on what those amounts are,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>The boxes are located just outside the airport terminal so items can be left before entering the building, no questions asked.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>The amnesty boxes, as they are called, are about the size of a large trash can and have been bolted securely to the ground. A drawer drop, similar to those on a corner mailbox, prevents anyone from reaching inside and keeps the contents safely inside until they are removed by a contractor.</p>
<h2>What Happens After A Drop-Off?</h2>
<div id="attachment_181699" style="max-width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-181699" src="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/airport-sets-amnesty-boxes-flyers-dispose-weed-1.jpg" alt="Airport Sets Up Amnesty Boxes For Flyers To Dispose Their Weed" width="1000" height="600"><p class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fa fa-camera"></i> Travel Weekly</p></div>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean a free stash for&#160;someone, however.</p>
<p>&#8220;They [the contractor] will be collecting whatever&#8217;s surrendered and disposing of it appropriately, depending on what contents are in these boxes,&#8221; Crews said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want your pot; leave it somewhere else, that&#8217;d be fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crews also noted that because cannabis is still illegal under United States laws, the drop boxes will enable the airport to avoid being complicit in smuggling marijuana across state lines.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>&#8220;Being a federally regulated industry, we want to make sure we are more than compliant with their standards,&#8221; Crews said.</p>
<p>The amnesty boxes seem to be getting a positive reaction from travelers.&#160;&#8220;I think they&#8217;re great, said Michael Aldaya, a visitor from Minnesota. &#8220;This is probably where you should dispose your drugs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aldaya hedged when asked if he had anything to leave in the boxes.&#160;&#8220;Uh&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to disclose that right now,&#8221; he joked.</p>
<p>But Shannon, in town from San Francisco, thinks the boxes might not get much use.&#160;&#8220;I feel like anyone who probably has some sort of cannabis, weed, would probably do it before they threw it away,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;d be interested to see how full that gets.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the first week of operation, the boxes have collected several vape pens and a plastic bag of pills, according to reports.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>Final Hit: Airport Sets Up Amnesty Boxes for Flyers to Dispose Their Weed</h2>
<p>So far, 13 of the amnesty boxes have been installed in high-traffic areas of the airport. Ten are located at the terminal, with three more at the car rental complex.</p>
<p>The Clark County Department of Aviation, the airport operator, has plans to install seven more of the amnesty boxes at other sites including the Henderson Executive Airport and the North Las Vegas Airport, bringing the total number to 20.</p>

<p>The World Soccer Association, FIFA, even allows people to bring and use narcotic prescription drugs including cannabis for personal needs, as long as the patients carry corresponding documentation in Russian and English. But because all stadiums will be non-smoking areas, edibles or vaping would be the only legal way for spectators to medicate for spectators.</p>
<p>In 2004, the European Football Association UEFA first experimented with the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jun/11/drugsandalcohol.football"> toleration of cannabis</a> use in stadiums simultaneously with alcohol during games at the European Soccer Championships. The 2004 Euro Soccer Cup is still considered one of the most non-violent soccer events.</p>

<p>The drum-tight unemployment rate and the frenetic pace of new restaurant openings are major factors. But as it turns out, people who are good on the kitchen prep line or in the dish room can make almost double the hourly wage trimming marijuana for sale.</p>

<hr>
<p>While there are no hard data on people leaving the restaurant industry for marijuana, many Denver chefs and restaurant owners believe pot is a major culprit for their cook conundrum.</p>
<p>&#8220;We go months trying to fill a position. It&#8217;s always been bad, but then they legalized marijuana and it got real bad. There&#8217;s no way we can pay what they&#8217;re paying,&#8221; said chef Justin Brunson, owner of the restaurants The Royal Rooster and Old Major Culture Meat and Cheese.</p>

<p>Entry-level bud trimmers make $12-15 an hour, but speedy cutters can earn upward of $20, according to cannarecruiter.com. This compares with average of $12.83 per hour paid to line and prep cooks &#8212; still above minimum wage, but considering the physical demands of kitchen work, many people choose jobs that don&#8217;t require them to perform near-constant aerobic feats in a windowless, 90-degree room.</p>

Gillman and Katie Leslie</strong>, <em> The Dallas Morning News</em></p>                                                <p>WASHINGTON &#8212; The fight between Sen. Ted Cruz and challenger <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/tag/beto-orourke/">Beto O&#8217;Rourke</a> pits a tea party darling who used his first term to run for the White House against a dynamic three-term congressman hoping to snap his party&#8217;s 25-year losing streak in Texas.</p>
<p>Both cleared the primaries on Tuesday with little resistance, and even before polls closed, Cruz was framing the race as a bid by &#8220;angry&#8221; Bernie Sanders-style liberals to attack Texas&#8217; conservative values.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congressman O&#8217;Rourke is a left-wing liberal Democrat,&#8221; said Cruz, who only recently began mentioning his rival by name, in a call with Texas reporters. &#8220;It is true that the extreme left is angry and energized and they hate the president &#8230; . But the good news is there are more conservatives than there are liberals in Texas.&#8221;</p>
<p>O&#8217;Rourke shrugged off the label and said that like voters, he&#8217;s focused on jobs, a living wage, education and affordable health care.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you define any of that on the political spectrum?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not running against anyone. I&#8217;m running with the people of Texas to do something really great for this country,&#8221; he said, adding: &#8220;There&#8217;s really not much I need to say about Senator Cruz. I trust the people of Texas. I trust their ability to make their own judgments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Texas Republicans haven&#8217;t lost statewide since 1994. But President Donald Trump looms over the midterm elections, and even in Texas, some voters will use their ballots to signal dismay with him and punish his most ardent defenders, among them Cruz.</p>

<hr>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a slam dunk,&#8221; said Jennifer Duffy, who tracks Senate races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. &#8220;Yeah it&#8217;s Texas, but the environment is bad even in Texas,&#8221; she said, adding that Trump &#8220;is going to be the third candidate on the ballot in a way that is very real &#8230; . Cruz might have to work for this one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cook ranks the race &#8220;likely Republican.&#8221; So does CNN, a recent downgrade from &#8220;Solid Republican.&#8221;</p>
<p>Republicans hold a 51-49 majority in the Senate. Of the 26 seats Democrats are defending, 10 are in states that Trump won. Trump won Texas, though by a smaller margin than recent GOP nominees.</p>
<p>The last Democrat to represent Texas in the Senate was Bob Krueger, an appointee who kept the seat warm for five months in 1993 after Democrat Lloyd Bentsen resigned to serve as Bill Clinton&#8217;s Treasury secretary. Kay Bailey Hutchison ousted Krueger in a special election. Cruz took over when she retired in 2012, after an upset win over then-Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in the primary.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is inconceivable to me that Senator Cruz loses in the fall,&#8221; said GOP strategist Rob Jesmer, former executive director of the party&#8217;s Senate campaign arm, the National Republican Senatorial Committee. &#8220;That being said, I think we are heading into a very challenging environment in the fall and that could result in a more competitive race than Texas Republicans are used to.&#8221;</p>
<p>On issues, the choice for voters is stark.</p>
<p>Cruz is among the most conservative members of the Senate and his take-no-prisoners style during his first term made him a major irritant both to Barack Obama and to GOP leaders.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Rourke has positioned himself as more of a moderate, though support for legalizing marijuana &#8212; not that he emphasizes that issue &#8212; is one of many stances that open him to attack.</p>
<p>They largely agree on support for free trade and NAFTA. But they diverge on Obamacare, immigration policy, border security and taxes. Cruz touts a top grade from the NRA and tweaked O&#8217;Rourke for earning an F over his support for restrictions on high capacity magazines and assault-style weapons.</p>
<p>Where O&#8217;Rourke accuses Cruz and Trump of a heartless approach to immigration and a foolish call for a border wall that would mainly antagonize a key trading partner, Cruz hits back that the Democrat supports open borders and amnesty for undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not remotely afraid to debate left-wing liberal socialists,&#8221; Cruz said in committing to debate his rival, noting that he faced off three times with Sanders on CNN over the past year, &#8220;and the values of Texas are not the values of Congressman O&#8217;Rourke or Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren or Chuck Schumer.&#8221;</p>
<p>O&#8217;Rourke, too, said he looked forward to debating his rival in coming months.</p>

<p>He contrasted his support for universal health care with Cruz instigating a 16-day government shutdown in 2013 in a bid to defund the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>He also noted that while they both won their seats in 2012, Cruz was angling for the White House almost immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ted Cruz leaves Texas and is campaigning in Iowa and is in New Hampshire, and he boasts of having visited every one of the 99 counties of Iowa,&#8221; O&#8217;Rourke said.</p>
<p>In the primaries, Cruz faced Houston energy lawyer Stefano de Stefano, Christian TV producer Bruce Jacobson Jr., accountant and self-described moderate Mary Miller, and former La Marque mayor Geraldine Sam.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Rourke faced Sema Hernandez, who described herself as a &#8220;progressive Berniecrat,&#8221; and retired postal worker Edward Kimbrough.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Rourke has raised more than $8.7 million since declaring his candidacy last March, topping Cruz in that same period. In the first six weeks of 2018 alone, he outraised Cruz $2.3 million to $800,000 &#8212; a wake-up call for Republicans who had assumed that Texas would remain a dependable fortress.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Rourke did this while shunning PAC money, endearing himself to grassroots Democrats but potentially hobbling himself for the fall.</p>
<p>GOP strategist Brendan Steinhauser, who ran Sen. John Cornyn&#8217;s 2014 race, said it would take at least $10 million to &#8220;run any semblance of a statewide campaign&#8221; against Cruz, preferably $25 million. That makes shunning PAC money a good talking point but a &#8220;big mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, Cruz enters the general campaign with a $6 million war chest, an edge of more than $1 million.</p>
<p>Outside groups on the right and left could pour money into Texas if they smell opportunity. But the party committees are likely to remain on the sidelines. With roughly 20 media markets in Texas, they can get more bang for the buck elsewhere.</p>
<p>Cruz enters the race with near universal name recognition, but also a reputation as a polarizing figure.</p>
<p>He adamantly refuses to accept responsibility for the 2013 shutdown, an episode that propelled his presidential aspirations, cementing the affection of conservatives and making him a reviled adversary for the left.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Rourke, by contrast, opened this campaign unknown beyond his El Paso base, far from the vote-rich regions around Dallas and Houston.</p>
<p>He has barnstormed Texas for months, drawing surprisingly large crowds in small and medium-sized cities that statewide Democratic candidates have neglected for years &#8212; though retail scale politics has limits in a state so vast.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is as simple and direct as democracy can get,&#8221; he said, adding that he plans to continue that approach.</p>

<hr>
<p>&#8220;O&#8217;Rourke has surpassed every expectation&#8221; in terms of attracting funds and attention, Duffy said.</p>
<p>But even if O&#8217;Rourke &#8220;looks like a Kennedy&#8221; and makes voters swoon with support for term limits and &#8220;doesn&#8217;t sound like a prepackaged candidate,&#8221; said Steinhauser, his chances hinge on &#8220;huge turnout&#8221; among Democrats.</p>
<p>Republicans profess little concern for Cruz&#8217;s prospects. But what they refer to euphemistically as a tough environment, Democrats call the &#8220;Trump factor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cruz has tied himself unabashedly to the divisive president and said Tuesday night that he welcomes Trump&#8217;s support.</p>
<p>Gilberto Hinojosa, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, said that even voters who don&#8217;t usually support Democrats &#8220;are sick and tired of the way the Republican Party is turning a blind eye to (Trump&#8217;s) incompetence, the corruption, and his playing footsie with the Russians.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the Cruz-Trump alliance is hardly the only line of attack Democrats will pursue.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got plenty of ammunition to use against him,&#8221; he said.</p>

(AP) &#8212; Supporters of legalizing medical marijuana in Kentucky made their case to a legislative panel Monday, touting it as a safe alternative to highly addictive opioid painkillers.</p>
<p>The bill heard by the House Judiciary Committee would strictly regulate the introduction of medical cannabis, and would leave it up to cities or counties whether to allow it. The panel took no vote on the measure, and its chairman said the bill would come up again later.</p>
<p>Showing their <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/15/kentucky-medical-marijuana-bill-2018/96782/">pent-up demand for action</a>, proponents packed the hearing and cheered when medical marijuana was touted as a viable option to help with chronic pain or certain diseases.</p>
<p>&#8220;House Bill 166 is not about a party,&#8221; said Jaime Montalvo, president of the group Kentuckians for Medicinal Marijuana. &#8220;It&#8217;s not about having fun. This is about sick patients, qualifying patients, having safe access to a plant created by our Creator.&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Update: <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/03/07/kentucky-medical-marijuana-law-enforcement/100674/">Kentucky medical marijuana bill runs into law enforcement opposition</a></strong></p>
<hr>
<p>The bill resulted from work by a task force led by Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 2014.</p>
<p>State Rep. John Sims Jr., the bill&#8217;s lead sponsor, said legalizing medical cannabis would help combat Kentucky&#8217;s deadly addiction woes from opioid painkillers. Supporters cited studies showing a sharp drop in opioid prescriptions in states where medical marijuana is allowed. Twenty-nine states have legalized it, they said.</p>
<p>Kentucky&#8217;s lack of a medical marijuana law has created a &#8220;medical refugee crisis,&#8221; said Sims, a Democrat from Flemingsburg. Kentuckians have uprooted their lives to seek the treatment for themselves or loved ones in states where medical cannabis is legal, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is about patients who have exhausted all their options and resources and now are begging us to pull our heads from the sand to help,&#8221; Sims told the committee.</p>

<p>The testimony Monday was limited to the bill&#8217;s supporters. Sims said he expected opponents to make their case at the next hearing.</p>
<p>Asked about the bill&#8217;s prospects, Sims told reporters: &#8220;We&#8217;re close on the votes.&#8221;</p>
<p>More than 20 House members from both parties have signed on as co-sponsors. The bill would strictly regulate and license use of medical cannabis in Kentucky, and those seeking access would have to clear multiple steps, including approval from a new state enforcement agency. </p>
<p>Potential patients would have to show they have qualifying conditions, such as cancer, chronic pain, multiple sclerosis and post-traumatic stress disorder. If approved, they would be given a special ID and would have to go to state-approved dispensaries to purchase the medical marijuana.</p>
<p>Each step of the process would be licensed &#8212; from those growing cannabis, to the processors, distributors and dispensaries. An excise tax would be imposed at the wholesale level.</p>
<p>Participation would be optional for local communities. City and county governing bodies would decide whether to allow local medical cannabis licensing. If elected officials refused to act, local residents eventually could mount efforts to put the issue on the local ballot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do the right thing,&#8221; Democratic state Rep. Al Gentry told the committee. &#8220;Give the people what they want, and allow certain suffering Kentuckians access to a product that is known to be safer and more effective for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The legislation is House Bill 166.</p>

<p>For a second straight day, the House Judiciary Committee heard testimony but took no vote on the measure. Committee Chairman </p>
<p>Joe Fischer said it could come up again Wednesday.</p>
<p>A day after <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/03/05/kentucky-medical-marijuana-legislative-hearing/100687/">hearing from medical marijuana supporters</a>, the panel took comments from law enforcement officials and a Warren County prosecutor. They warned that legalization could exacerbate Kentucky&#8217;s drug addiction woes.</p>

<hr>
<p>&#8220;This is a road we do not want to go down,&#8221; said Chris Cohron, representing the Kentucky Commonwealth&#8217;s Attorneys Association.</p>
<p>Legalizing medical cannabis would send the wrong message, creating &#8220;a dangerous illusion&#8221; that marijuana is safe, Daviess County Sheriff Keith Cain said. That would be &#8220;a sure prescription for increased use,&#8221; especially among young people, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;My opposition to this legislation isn&#8217;t because I lack compassion for the sick, but because I think it&#8217;s wrong to herald marijuana &#8212; with its many proven negative qualities,&#8221; the sheriff said.</p>
<p>Opponents also included groups representing police chiefs and narcotics officers.</p>
<p>Tommy Loving, representing the Kentucky Narcotic Officers&#8217; Association, pointed to a section of the bill that would allow each medical marijuana patient to possess up to 12 mature cannabis plants. That would equal about 12 pounds of harvested marijuana, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just can&#8217;t imagine what disability you&#8217;d need 12 pounds of marijuana,&#8221; he said.<br>
A day earlier, medical marijuana supporters said the bill would strictly regulate medical cannabis and leave it up to cities or counties whether to allow it.</p>

<p>The bill would license use of medical cannabis. Those seeking access would have to clear multiple steps, including approval from a new state enforcement agency. Potential patients would have to show they have qualifying conditions, such as cancer, chronic pain, multiple sclerosis and post-traumatic stress disorder.

<p>Some committee members started staking out their positions on the bill Tuesday.</p>
<p>Rep. Jason Nemes said he ran for office as a medical marijuana opponent, but said his position evolved after listening to advocates. He&#8217;s now a legalization supporter, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who the heck do we think we are as a government to keep this away from people if it helps them,&#8221; the Louisville Republican said.</p>
<p>But he added that he couldn&#8217;t vote for the bill in its current form.</p>
<p>After the hearing, <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/15/kentucky-medical-marijuana-bill-2018/96782/">medical marijuana advocate Eric Crawford said he wouldn&#8217;t give up the fight</a>, regardless of what happens to this year&#8217;s bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming here whether the bill passes or not. I&#8217;ll be here next year &#8230; trying to get it passed again,&#8221; the Mason County man said.</p>
<p>The legislation is House Bill 166.</p>

<p>JUNEAU, Alaska (<em>AP</em>) &#8212; Taking a cue from the fight over immigration, some states that have legalized marijuana are considering providing so-called sanctuary status for licensed pot businesses, hoping to protect the fledgling industry from a shift in federal enforcement policy.</p>
<p>Just hours after U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on Jan. 4 that federal prosecutors would be free to crack down on marijuana operations as they see fit, Jesse Arreguin, the mayor in Berkeley, California, summoned city councilman Ben Bartlett to his office with a novel idea.</p>
<p>Berkeley was already the first city in the nation to formally declare itself a sanctuary city on immigration, barring city officials from cooperating with federal authorities. Why not do the same thing with marijuana? Last month, it did.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew we had to do something,&#8221; Bartlett said. &#8220;This is a new engine of a healthy economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others may soon follow Berkeley&#8217;s lead: Alaska, California and Massachusetts lawmakers are among those with similar bills pending, though the chances for passage is unclear.</p>
<p>Alaska state Rep. Adam Wool, who owns a movie, restaurant and concert venue with a liquor license in Fairbanks, said he introduced his bill as both a statement and a precaution.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the federal government wants to prosecute someone for breaking federal law, I guess they have every right to do that,&#8221; said Wool, a Democrat from one of Alaska&#8217;s major marijuana-growing areas. &#8220;I&#8217;m just saying, we will have no obligation to assist them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sessions&#8217; announcement invalidated a 2013 policy that allowed for legalized marijuana to flourish by limiting federal enforcement of the drug, as long as states prevented it from getting to places it was outlawed and kept it from gangs and children. His action also unsettled the industry and spooked potential marijuana industry investors. Marijuana is still illegal under federal law.</p>
<p>Casey O&#8217;Neill remembers helicopter enforcement raids of grow sites in California when he was growing up in the 1980s. It was then that his parents, carpenters who grew small amounts of cannabis, became school teachers, he said.</p>
<p>He now helps run a farm that produces vegetables and marijuana for medical use near Laytonville, California, and is glad lawmakers are looking at ways to push back against the federal government.</p>
<p>Over the years, enforcement &#8220;has been uneven, we&#8217;ll say, and that&#8217;s kind of one of the things about it. It just means that everybody&#8217;s always afraid, and that&#8217;s hard,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Dale Gieringer, director of California NORML, a marijuana advocacy group, said California has a lousy history with the federal government on marijuana enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the feds care too much about marijuana in Alaska, to tell you the truth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But marijuana has been a big industry in this state, so we&#8217;re sort of on the front lines.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no apparent panic in the industry over Sessions&#8217; change in policy, given limited federal resources and prosecutors having had discretion in bringing cases all along. But there isn&#8217;t complacency, either.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the federal government is going to effectively step in and wipe us out of business. I just find that hard to believe at this point. But they can make it hard for us,&#8221; said Jennifer Canfield, who co-owns a state-licensed marijuana cultivation operation and retail store in Alaska&#8217;s capital city, Juneau.</p>
<p>Peter Mlynarik, a police chief in Soldotna, Alaska, called the Alaska bill a terrible idea. He asked what would happen if a local agency were helping the federal government on a heroin bust but also found marijuana in the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s crazy to put that burden on, especially, police officers that are supposed to obey federal laws,&#8221; said Mlynarik, who resigned from Alaska&#8217;s marijuana regulatory board after Sessions&#8217; actions in January, saying it stripped the underpinning for the state&#8217;s legal marijuana industry.</p>
<p>Morgan Fox, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, said he can&#8217;t see federal agents raiding businesses that are complying with state law.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t put it past them,&#8221; he said, adding that new U.S. attorneys have been appointed by President Donald Trump in many states. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t put it past at least a few of them to want to gain points with their boss. But I think, politically, it would be a disaster for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Massachusetts&#8217; sanctuary-style bill was prompted by comments from that state&#8217;s U.S. attorney, Andrew Lelling, who declined to rule out prosecuting commercial marijuana businesses that are legal under state law. He later said his priority would be prosecuting opioid crimes, not marijuana.</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam declined comment on the pending bills.</p>

This was my first Smokers Club experience, and it was a doozy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, the soul-shattering bass of <a href="https://www.marijuana.com/news/2016/05/hightunes-perfect-weed-pairings-for-chance-the-rapper-radiohead-and-ricky-hil-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ricky Hil&#8217;s </a></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">SYLDD</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> set the stage, followed by my introduction to Mississippi&#8217;s underappreciated treasure of an artist, Big K.R.I.T. Next came one of the more memorable live sets of my entire life, seeing a broken-legged Curren$y perform from a couch that was carried around by his stagehands. The set was quite inspirational as the dense smoke in the air was making me yearn for a similar piece of furniture to nab a quick siesta. The night closed out with a set from Wu-Tang Clansman Method Man, who somehow parted the clouds of kush in the air as he walked on the hands of the crowd as if he was the marijuana messiah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had been to concerts and seen people smoking weed at said concerts before &#8212; and maybe had even partaken. But I had never been to a concert curated by and for the everyday weed smoker, where cannabis culture was not only embraced but celebrated. It was special and magical and made me oh-so-hungry after, which was fine because New Haven pizza is world-renowned and coming up with reasons to buy slices is part of a very unique set of skills I possess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fast forward to 2018, and weed culture has come quite a long way since 2011 &#8212; like, it&#8217;s actually legalized in many places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, some of the biggest concerts and festivals in the country still take a prohibitionist stance on cannabis, even when they profit directly from the culture by booking artists that make weed-friendly music and subsequently attract cannabis smokers to buy tickets.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.marijuana.com/news/2018/01/coachella-really-doesnt-want-you-bringing-weed-into-the-festival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read: Coachella Doesn&#8217;t Want You Bringing Weed Into the Festival</a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Coachella, the biggest culprit of them all, came out this year and reaffirmed their restrictive rules on marijuana at the festival. Arguably the most recognized mega-festival on Earth, Coachella is held in California, where cannabis culture is well established and the plant is now legal for adult-use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Smokers Club has remained true to its roots all these years, and like the plant it champions, keeps growing and growing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, this year Smokers Club is going through its biggest transformation ever, transitioning from a tour of medium-sized venues to a full-blown two-day festival held in weed-rap mecca <a href="https://weedmaps.com/earth/us/ca/long-beach/90813" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Long Beach</a>, California.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The two-day smoke-out boasts an insane lineup sure to please fans young and slightly less young, featuring the reclusive Kid Cudi, Schoolboy Q, and Wiz Khalifa performing his classic project <em>Kush &amp; Orange Juice</em> in its entirety. The inaugural Smokers Club Festival also features buzzing newcomers like Trippie Redd, Lil Skies, Dave East, and Isaiah Rashad. Seasoned veterans of the Smokers Club tour like </span><a href="https://www.marijuana.com/news/2017/09/flying-high-with-curreny-on-the-pilot-talk-trilogy-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Curren$y</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, The Underachievers, and Juicy J are returning for the festival, going down April 28-29, as is Smokers Club co-founder </span><a href="https://www.marijuana.com/news/2016/06/an-exclusive-interview-with-smoke-dza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Smoke DZA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_82299" style="max-width: 712px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-82299 size-large" src="https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SMOKE-DZA-3PIECE-1024x683.jpg" alt="rolling-blunt-rapper" width="702" height="468" srcset="https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SMOKE-DZA-3PIECE-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SMOKE-DZA-3PIECE-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SMOKE-DZA-3PIECE-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SMOKE-DZA-3PIECE.jpg 1200w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SMOKE-DZA-3PIECE-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px"><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Photo courtesy of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jake_kirby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jake Kirby</a></em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Smoke DZA and fellow founder Jonnyshipes have been cultivating this club since it was a seedling of a tour way back in 2010, working their way through the growing pains to see their idea harvested into the massive success this festival seems like it will be (it&#8217;s just about sold out).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Marijuana.com sat down with Shipes, the owner of New York-based label Cinematic Music Group, and DZA, a Harlem-raised rapper with an extensive resume, to gain some insight into the decision to expand and their thoughts on weed culture at concerts, among other things. Spoiler alert: we also smoked a bunch of weed.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Marijuana.com:</strong> DZA, what&#8217;s it like hitting that Smokers Club stage?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Smoke DZA:</strong> As one of the founders of Smokers Club, it&#8217;s a different feeling when I hit that stage. I&#8217;m way more invested. This is our Coachella, our Bonnaroo, something for our culture. It&#8217;s unique and needed, a lot of people try to duplicate it but it doesn&#8217;t get better than the original.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>MJ:</strong> How special will it be this year to have legends like Kid Cudi and Wiz Khalifa on the bill?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>DZA:</strong> It&#8217;s fucking surreal. Even [Schoolboy] Q and Spitta, and 2 Chainz, there&#8217;s a lot of great people there this year. I&#8217;m interested to watch the show both days, even when I&#8217;m not performing. I&#8217;m just going to be a fan because there&#8217;s a lot of people I want to see, even though I was bitching about the flyer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Jonnyshipes:</strong> The flyer is my fault!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>DZA:</strong> [Laughs] They have to put some respect on my name, man. My shit is mad small on there. All due respect to the other guys on the bill, but who the fuck are these other guys and why is my name so microscopic?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>MJ:</strong> That did catch my eye.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-82301" src="https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/tscf18_poster_v1-745x1024.jpg" alt="festival-lineup" width="702" height="965" srcset="https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/tscf18_poster_v1-745x1024.jpg 745w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/tscf18_poster_v1-218x300.jpg 218w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/tscf18_poster_v1-768x1056.jpg 768w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/tscf18_poster_v1.jpg 1250w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/tscf18_poster_v1-218x300@2x.jpg 436w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> DZA called me about it and I didn&#8217;t even realize what was going on yet, but I would be heated, too. I don&#8217;t want to blame others because I&#8217;m in business with them, but they basically took the artwork and put it out a day and a half before we knew about it. It was just upsetting because DZA&#8217;s name was higher on the version we were going to put out. They just jumped the gun, which was a little whack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>MJ:</strong> Was the tour always building toward this or what prompted the change to a festival format?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> As DZA, Spitta, and KRIT were starting to pop and people kept asking about a tour, underground rap wasn&#8217;t really traveling like that. You had to be a Jay or Dre or somebody huge to get a good tour going. We were very ahead of the curve, and for the first few years of the tour, it was very different than anything anyone had experienced before. Now that Soundcloud and other streaming sites have helped bring a lot more underground rap to the forefront, you have a million of these hip-hop tours. It&#8217;s the dominant genre in music right now, and in any given month, there&#8217;s four, five, six rap tours going in and out of every city. For us, it felt like it was time to look for something bigger. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I went to Coachella two years ago with Joey [Bada$$], it was the first time I was experiencing festival culture at that magnitude. It just hit me that we have this great brand in Smokers Club and maybe we&#8217;ve been doing it wrong the past couple of years. Last year, we took a step back and didn&#8217;t do the tour. We just wanted to figure out what the Smokers Club is really going to be.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>MJ:</strong> How big of a role does marijuana play in concert and festival culture, and is it disheartening when big-name properties like Coachella turn their back on weed?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> You can&#8217;t smoke weed at Coachella? That&#8217;s crazy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>DZA:</strong> That&#8217;s fucked up, it takes away from the experience. For us, the stoners, and all those with hippie tendencies, the weed is a huge part of the music and the experience overall. It would be blasphemous for us to try to tell people not to smoke at Smokers Club.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> Certain people sniff cocaine or take molly to go experience their music at an EDM festival, so why would anyone care about marijuana?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>DZA:</strong> That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re cooler, just come to our shit. The weed will be flowing and the blunts will be burning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> Wait until we make the announcement of all announcements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>MJ:</strong> C&#8217;mon, let us get the scoop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> What I can tell you is that we&#8217;re going to shoot a film called &#8220;The Smokers Club&#8221; at the Smokers Club Festival and it&#8217;ll be a mockumentary, kind of like a &#8220;Spinal Tap.&#8221; Wiz will be in it, Cam&#8217;Ron will be in it, Dom Kennedy will be in it, Mac [Miller] is going to be in it. It&#8217;ll be hysterical, just about how frazzled Smokers Club was in the beginning. In the early days, I was damn near a janky promoter, we just rented a van&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>DZA:</strong> No, we had a tour bus. But it was wild, we were missing shows and shit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>MJ:</strong> Why were you guys missing shows?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> [Laughs] We just didn&#8217;t know what we were doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>DZA:</strong> We were in Philly or something and had to go to Canada next and Shipes overslept. We were blowing up your phone.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_82305" style="max-width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-82305 size-full" src="https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_2227.jpg" alt="interview-rapper" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_2227.jpg 1000w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_2227-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_2227-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_2227-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Photo courtesy of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jake_kirby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jake Kirby</a></em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> It was me that made us miss the show?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>DZA:</strong> Yes, it was you! I kept calling you. I had something else booked in Vancouver besides the show so I was extra mad because you made me miss both. Then once you were finally ready to go, we got stuck at the border. We always get jammed at the border, but if we had left on time, we had the border calculated into our schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> I have to fact check this story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>DZA:</strong> Nah, this is all facts. I will say those first few years were Maniacville because we were all together with a bunch of fire weed. This guy isn&#8217;t just Jonny Shipes, he&#8217;s a part of the fuckery, too. You would think the artists are the ones going wild on tour but it&#8217;s him.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>MJ:</strong> So, now it&#8217;s fun and makes money?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> The best of both worlds.

<p>Pennsylvania medical <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a> dispensaries already have shortages, just over two weeks after the beginning of the state&#8217;s medical marijuana program.</p>
<p><a href="https://hightimes.com/news/pennsylvania-start-medical-marijuana-sales-week/">Pennsylvania&#8217;s medicinal cannabis program</a> launched on February 16. But so far only one distributor, Cresco Yeltrah, has actually started shipping medicine. The remaining wholesalers should start coming online by the end of the month.</p>
<h2>Empty Shelves</h2>
<p>The shelves are bare at the two dispensaries in the Philadelphia area.&#160;Chris Visco co-owns the TerraVida Holistic Center in Sellersville. He <a href="http://triblive.com/state/pennsylvania/13382382-74/pennsylvanias-medical-marijuana-program-hobbled-by-lack-of-products-to-sell" rel="nofollow">told&#160;local media</a> that his shop is selling product almost as fast as they can get it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no inventory. We took a shipment on Wednesday. On Thursday, we had the biggest sales day we&#8217;ve ever had. By this morning, all we had left were a handful of disposable vape pens,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Visco added that the preliminary results are beyond his wildest expectations.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>&#8220;Pennsylvania&#8217;s market is much larger than anybody anticipated,&#8221; Visco said. &#8220;No one could have projected it. I had projected 60 people initially for the entire month,&#8221; Visco said. &#8220;We had over 600 patients in our first eight days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Management of the Keystone Shop in Devon decided to close up shop until they receive more merchandise.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking at resuming sales the third week in March,&#8221; said Skip Shuda, Keystone Shop&#8217;s chief operating officer. &#8220;It&#8217;s frustrating for us, and it&#8217;s frustrating for a lot of patients who were looking for medicine.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Limiting Sales</h2>
<p>Other shops are taking different measures to deal with the shortage. Victor Guadagnino owns Keystone Canna Remedies in Bethlehem.</p>
<p>He implemented a cap on purchases so he would be able to serve more customers. Patients can purchase only two vape cartridges each.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>When the product runs out, the dispensary will remain open to provide patient consultations. Guadagnino expects the industry&#8217;s problems to be short-lived.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going through some growing pains,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But as other providers come online, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll see this issue again.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Low Supply Means High Prices</h2>
<p>Product shortages and high taxes on cannabis translate into higher prices for consumers. Cannabis activist Mike Whiter <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/business/cannabis/medical-marijuana-first-week-legal-pa-sales-20180226.html" rel="nofollow">told the Philadelphia Inquirer</a> that patients are paying too much.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those prices are ridiculous,&#8221; said marijuana activist Mike Whiter. &#8220;The dispensaries have a near monopoly on this medicine and it bothers the hell out of me to see what they&#8217;re charging.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Shuda of Keystone Shop predicts that prices will stabilize soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an early market, and we have a single supplier, and we&#8217;ll need to calibrate over time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Real estate is expensive on the Main Line and we have to make sure our expenses are covered.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>Final Hit: Pennsylvania Medical Marijuana Dispensaries Already Have Shortages</h2>
<p>Nearly 20,000 patients have registered with the state medical marijuana program. Of those, more than 5,000 have already received a doctor&#8217;s certification. The state has authorized close to 400 physicians to recommend cannabis to their patients.</p>
<p>Eventually, 51 dispensaries will serve Pennsylvania&#8217;s medical marijuana patients.&#160; The state has licensed 12 firms to cultivate and process cannabis products will serve them.</p>
<p>Therefore, April Hutcheson, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Health, suggested patients plan ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;We encourage patients to call the dispensaries to find out if they have what they need and to set up a consultation,&#8221; she said.</p>

<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Medical cannabis works. I&#8217;ve seen firsthand lives it has positively impacted. I&#8217;ve seen how quality of life is vastly improved when a veteran struggling with PTSD can use medical cannabis to quiet their mind and sleep. It&#8217;s time we move away from the old-school mentalities that are holding our Commonwealth back and preventing Kentuckians from getting relief. I see legalization of medical cannabis as a huge step in fighting the opioid crisis. Frankfort has to act. There are too many people &#8211; especially men and women who have served our country &#8211; who need help. I&#8217;m counting on legislators and the Governor to make medical cannabis legal in 2018.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kentucky&#8217;s Secretary of State is hoping to cultivate Republican support for medicinal cannabis by appealing to the conservative ideal of state&#8217;s rights, which has been referenced in bipartisan support for similar efforts in other states. Grimes said she believes that by appealing to one of the GOP&#8217;s core philosophies and focusing on medicinal cannabis as a states&#8217; rights issue, she can sway at least some of the staunch conservatives within Kentucky&#8217;s Republican Party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If folks are really believing in states&#8217; rights, as the Republican-led administration in Washington claims to be, the Republican-led administration here in Frankfort, at all levels from the governor to each chamber in our House and Senate, then they will see this as what it is, a states&#8217; rights issue,&#8221; Grimes said in January.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">CANNABIS CULTURE &#8211; For decades, Egypt&#8217;s hands-off approach to the Bedouin drug trade has allowed Israeli visitors to get as high as they like while vacationing on the golden beaches of the Sinai peninsula. Luckily for Elyasaf, who had been caught crossing the border with marijuana on his person, that lax enforcement also allowed his brothers back in Israel to secure his speedy release from the dingy Egyptian jail cell he shared with Ablel the Eritrean refugee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sympathetic political power-brokers guided Elyasaf&#8217;s family through a web of Egyptian bureaucracy, helping them assuage the local legal authorities, without triggering a diplomatic incident that would destroy his chances for freedom. &#8220;I&#8217;m not especially proud that I made this mistake,&#8221; Elyasaf admits. &#8220;I may also be an idiot for taking that chance. Alright. I also had to pay the price for it. But I&#8217;m not ashamed of what I do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon realizing that he would soon be permitted to return to Israel, Elyasaf&#8217;s attention turned to Ablel, and to figuring our how to help the young man who had helped him survive an Egyptian jail. &#8220;He really gave me a lot of strength. I owe this man so much,&#8221; Elyasaf said. &#8220;If I was able to relay a message from this man, then it will have been worth everything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without anyone else to communicate with for days on end, Elyasaf&#8217;s time in the Egyptian jail gave him the opportunity to get to know his cellmate &#8211; something that may never have happened naturally in Tel Aviv, where it is rare for native Israelis interact with African asylum-seekers as equals. &#8220;He is a skilled artist,&#8221; Elyasaf recalled. &#8220;He carved massive designs into the wall there, and all kinds of slogans about freedom, he said. &#8220;There was a massive dove carved onto the entire wall, very beautiful.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ablel&#8217;s fondness for music was apparent to Elyasaf. &#8220;I taught him the words to &#8216;Imagine&#8217; by John Lennon,&#8221; Elyasaf added. &#8220;He loved those lyrics so much, he wanted to know them in Hebrew. He said that one day, he would sing it in his own language.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The miles Ablel had put between himself and his Bedouin captors relieved some of his stress, and he eventually managed to recall the phone number of his sister Adi, also living in Israel. During his final hours behind bars, Elyasaf committed her phone number to memory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="wp-image-69888 alignright" src="https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feb2013a-296x350.jpg" alt="" width="494" height="584" srcset="https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feb2013a-296x350.jpg 296w, https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feb2013a.jpg 612w, https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feb2013a-296x350@2x.jpg 592w" sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px">&#8220;I guess I will never forget that phone number for the rest of my life. I barely remember my own mobile phone number, but I definitely won&#8217;t forget hers.&#8221; As soon as he crossed Israel&#8217;s borders, Elyasaf phoned Adi to let her know that Ablel was still alive, that he had endured horrible tortures, and that he was now in poor but stable health, just a few minutes&#8217; drive from Israeli sovereign territory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having discharged his duty, Elyasaf soon settled back into his regular routine. But he remained troubled by Ablel&#8217;s experiences, and what they might mean for others living in Israel, especially African refugees. &#8220;Now, you hear this story, and you don&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; Elyasaf said. &#8220;It sounds unbelievable. And really, if I wasn&#8217;t there, if I didn&#8217;t meet the young man and hear it from him myself, with him there in the Egyptian jail, lying next to me, and I see that it&#8217;s true, I wouldn&#8217;t believe that something like this is possible. What kind of country do we live in? A man is kidnapped in the middle of the day from downtown Tel Aviv!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Elyasaf is cognizant of his privileges, aware that being an Israeli Jew of European ancestry shielded him from any serious suffering, after he got caught with weed in a third-world country. But he also believes that those privileges should be extended to Ablel, as well. &#8220;Not that it matters, but the man is Israeli. He is totally Israeli, Israeli in every single way. And I think that the State of Israel must take responsibility.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Held for ransom, then forced to Pay</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the case of Ablel, the Israeli state&#8217;s obligations were clear-cut: to protect his person, prevent his removal from its territory, investigate his disappearance and secure his safe return. These obligations were not fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But some observers contend that Israeli culpability for the situation in the Sinai extends well beyond the strange singular case of Ablel. If the actual torture of the Eritreans occurred in Egyptian territory, the ransom collection most often occurred on Israeli soil. Eritreans living all over the world contributed funds in order to redeem their countrymen-and-women from captivity and torture in the Egyptian Sinai. But more often than not, the traffickers were paid by Eritreans living in Tel Aviv, who had already run the ghastly gauntlet themselves and knew from firsthand experience of the captors&#8217; cruelty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Most of the payments were being paid in Tel Aviv. The kidnappers had always agents working in Tel Aviv. A lot of people, they were paid in person. There are at least twenty-one court cases of people that were arrested for receiving money for the traffickers. Most of the time, it would have been easy to arrest many more people, but there was no interest from the police,&#8221; Eritrean-Swedish journalist Meron Estefanos told Cannabis Culture. &#8220;The twenty-one cases, it was very rare, compared to how many people were being held hostage and how much money was being paid.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On one of her many visits to Israel to interview Eritrean asylum-seekers, Estefanos approached the Israeli police herself, hoping that if she informed them of an impending ransom payment, it would spur them to action. &#8220;We knew a payment was going to happen tomorrow morning. And then you contact the police, but there was no interest&#8221; in arresting the ransom collectors, Estefanos said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sums of money that were extorted from Eritrean asylum-seekers living in Israel were vast, she explains. &#8220;When I visited Israel in 2012, there was this sign in Tigrinya in Tel Aviv, all over the streets, where it said that a hundred twenty-seven Eritreans from one region were being held hostage in Sinai. And when I visited Lewinsky Park, Eritreans from that area were collecting money,&#8221; says Estefanos. &#8220;Hundreds of Eritreans.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In that one instance alone, she notes, Eritreans in Israel collected a seven-figure sum to secure the freedom of their kidnapped compatriots. &#8220;That they were trying to raise $8.7 million. It&#8217;s in the letter of the sign that was put in the streets of Tel Aviv. It&#8217;s a lot of money! And this money was paid in person, in Tel Aviv. So this was happening on a weekly, daily basis.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Israel&#8217;s tacit acceptance of the Egyptian torture camps</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even worse than Israel&#8217;s anemic efforts to terminate the trafficking on its own end were its tolerance of the torture camps themselves, though these were mostly located within visual range of the Israeli border. &#8220;You could see the fence from some of the houses that we visited, outside the torture camps that we visited,&#8221; notes Estefanos. &#8220;Even the hostages, when they were being held hostage, they used to say that they can see the Israeli radar.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naturally, the primary responsibility for putting an end to torture camps in Egypt lies with the Egyptian government. But the country&#8217;s 1979 peace agreement with Israel forbids it from moving military forces into the peninsula without Israel&#8217;s expressed permission. If Egyptian authorities in Cairo ever asked Israel for approval to send in a force capable of shutting down the human trafficking operation, it was never given.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Egypt can be in the area only if the country is threatened. Because of the Camp David Agreement between Israel and Egypt, Sinai was decided to be kept as a demilitarized zone. So if the country is not threatened, Egypt has to ask for permission to have military in the area,&#8221; says Estefanos. &#8220;And these Bedouins knew this, and they were actually bragging that it would never happen, even in a hundred years. And they were saying, &#8216;You cannot stop us.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the Egyptian army refrained from interfering in the Sinai torture-extortion racket, the Israeli Defense Forces conducted military operations in the Sinai, for its own reasons. While the torture went on, right under everyone&#8217;s noses, the Israeli army regularly entered sovereign Egyptian territory, with Cairo&#8217;s permission &#8211; sometimes to attack Muslim militants operating in the Sinai, and sometimes to prevent groups of African refugees from reaching the Israeli border. At no point did it take any action to shut down the tortures camps just outside its territorial borders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The Bedouins believed that Israel would never bomb them,&#8221; recalls Estefanos. &#8220;They would never do that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The existence of the Sinai torture camps had long been a matter of public record &#8211; multiple mainstream media outlets have reported on the agonies inflicted there. Even by its own admission, the Israeli government had received reports of the torture camps at least as early as 2009. But even though Israel is internationally famous for conducting complex military operations to free kidnapped hostages being held thousands of kilometers away in the African interior, it allowed thousands of refugees to be mercilessly tortured for years, right in its own backyard.</span></p>
<p><strong>Eritrean refugees forced to return to the dictatorship he fled from</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still jailed in the Sinai, Ablel beseeched the prison authorities to release him into Egypt, or to send him to Israel, or at least to Ethiopia, where hundreds of thousands of Eritreans have received refuge. But they refused, and would only agree to put him on a plane back to Asmara, the capital of Eritrea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ablel had valid reasons to fear his forced repatriation. The reasons that he had left Eritrea to begin with were still valid; President Isaias Afwerki continued to rule the country with an iron fist, as he had since it first achieved independence from Ethiopia in 1993. Moreover, during his time in Israel, Ablel had participated in protests against the repressive regime that he had fled, and he worried that word of this would get back to Asmara.<img class=" wp-image-69889 alignleft" src="https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/C2-259x350.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="632" srcset="https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/C2-259x350.jpg 259w, https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/C2.jpg 694w, https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/C2-259x350@2x.jpg 518w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;At the freedom demonstration in Israel, I was in the middle of it,&#8221; says Ablel. &#8220;So, I had a big fear about going back to Eritrea. A really big fear. But I couldn&#8217;t do anything.&#8221; He grudgingly accepted Egypt&#8217;s terms and boarded a flight back to his home country. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want that at all. I just wanted to get out,&#8221; Ablel insists. Upon his arrival in Asmara, he was separated from the other passengers and cross-examined by Eritrean officials. &#8220;When you were in Israel, what were you doing?&#8221; they asked him. &#8220;I was working in the field and I&#8217;m young, I don&#8217;t know about anything,&#8221; Ablel responded, playing dumb. But the officials were not convinced. &#8220;You were there with the ones badmouthing their country and government, you&#8217;re from that group,&#8221; they said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed certain that he would soon face another round of abuse, this time in his home country. But because Ablel&#8217;s health had so obviously deteriorated, the government officials grilling him gave him permission to see a medical doctor right away. And once he was left alone in the doctor&#8217;s office, he immediately escaped and went underground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the next five months, Ablel laid low in the Eritrean capital of Asmara, surviving under the radar with the help of old friends. They arranged for him to receive the necessary medical attention, and secured for him forged documents. After five months, once he had fully healed, Ablel once again took his leave of Eritrea. This time, he brought one of his younger sisters along with him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, Ablel lives in Switzerland with his new wife Luelawit, together with their young son. In 2017, the country tightened its rules regarding refugees from Eritrea, but Ablel was still able to receive full residency rights, with the help of documentation provided by Cannabis Culture. Today, he can finally live a normal life, free of the fears that plagued him for the past decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But for Ablel&#8217;s sister Adi and the remaining 30,000 Eritrean refugees still living in Israel, the future remains uncertain. In early 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Eritrean refugees have until April 1 to leave the country, or be rounded up and jailed indefinitely.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212; END &#8212;</span></p>
<p><em>Cannabis Culture contacted both the Israeli police and the Israeli army, requesting comment; neither the police nor the army had responded to the story by press time, <span class="aBn"><span class="aQJ">twelve days later.</span></span></em></p>

					<p><span style="font-weight: 400">CANNABIS CULTURE &#8211; I am often asked, &#8220;What makes cannabis medicine?&#8221; This question leads to more questions, like &#8220;What condition/s can I use cannabis for? How much cannabis do I need to use, and how often? What strain or product do I use for my condition?&#8221; </span><span id="more-69894"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tired of shrugging my shoulders and simply responding, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; I thought it was time to undertake my own research to add to what is already out there. So, I asked 4,276 patients, &#8220;What condition/s do you use cannabis for?&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure, we have plenty of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">in vitro</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">in vivo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and animal studies, and even some high-quality human trials, but a sample study of this size is practically unheard of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Does the study and survey answer once-and-for-all any of the big questions that people come up to us and ask? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sadly, no. We still have to say, there are no definite answers. However, our survey does uncover a few things, notably the huge number of conditions (39 were mentioned, including depression, epilepsy, chronic pain, trigeminal neuralgia, PTSD and many more) people use cannabis to help them with, and a little bit about the pharmaceuticals that people replace with cannabis. Some key findings from our survey include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">63% out of 4,276 use cannabis for anxiety.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">60% use cannabis for insomnia.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">43% use cannabis for depression.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">36% use cannabis for pain.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">25% use cannabis for headaches.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">35% use cannabis for general wellbeing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Types of medication reduced or replaced thanks to using medical marijuana: painkillers (51%); antidepressants (27%); anxiolytics (10%); barbiturates (3%); anticonvulsants (2%).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Indicas were preferred by 35% of patients. Sativas were preferred by 25%, hybrids by 16% and 5% CBD-only.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">61% of medical marijuana patients use cannabis daily.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">74% of those surveyed use less than 1g of cannabis on the days they use it.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The most commonly-mentioned names when it came to preferred strain types include OG Kush, Blue Dream, and Gorilla Glue #1 and #4, although Girl Scout Cookies, Jack Herer, Blackberry Kush, Northern Lights, Trainwreck and AC/DC were also quite popular.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, this survey is not a clinical trial, and like many studies out there at the moment on cannabis, not a lot can be concluded from it. However, what this sort of survey does do is give us a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">rough guide</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> of where to go, as well as what we can do better in future. In some ways, a survey like this one confirms some of the things that we already talk about, like the huge number of health problems cannabis could potentially used for and its potential as a replacement for opioids and &#8220;pharmaceutical cocktails&#8221; when managing long-term pain. The question of how and why cannabis works still needs an answer, but we can posit a few theories &#8230;</span></p>
<p><b>THC and Opioid Receptors</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are four main types of opioid receptor, including:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Delta (&#948;) DOR OP</b><b>1</b><b>(I)</b><b> &#8211; Subtypes &#948; 1 and &#948; 2 &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> responsible for analgesic, antidepressant and convulsant effects. May play a role in respiratory depression and physical dependence.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Kappa (&#954;) KOR OP</b><b>2</b><b>(I)</b><b> &#8211; Subtypes &#954; 1, &#954; 2 and &#954; 3 &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> responsible for analgesic, anticonvulsant, dissociative/hallucinatory, diuretic and sedative effects. Kappa opioid receptors also play a role in depression, miosis (constriction of the pupil), neuroprotection and stress.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Mu (&#956;) MOR OP</b><b>3</b><b>(I)</b><b> &#8211; Subtypes &#956; 1, &#956; 2 and &#956; 3 &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> responsible for analgesia and physical dependence, (mu 1); respiratory depression, miosis, euphoria, reduced GI motility and physical dependence (mu 2); and possibly vasodilation (mu 3). The delta-opioid receptors may also interact with mu-opioid receptors to induce respiratory depression.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Nociceptin NOR OP</b><b>4</b><b>(I)</b><b> &#8211; Subtype ORL1 &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> responsible for anxiety, depression, appetite and development of tolerance to &#956;-opioid receptor agonists.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Experiments on animal models have shown THC to have an effect on </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15619107"><span style="font-weight: 400">mu-opioid receptors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and possibly the </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11826143"><span style="font-weight: 400">kappa opioid receptors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, too. Cannabis could potentially help beat chronic pain, as well as cravings for opioids.</span></p>
<p><b>The Entourage Effect</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cannabis is full of various cannabinoids and terpenoids. THC, CBD, CBG, myrcene humulene, beta-caryophyllene and </span><a href="https://www.cannabisculture.com/content/2018/02/13/what-about-terpenes"><span style="font-weight: 400">much, much more besides</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. This unique mixture of phytochemicals not only gives us a clue as to the individual cannabis plant&#8217;s physiological and (if any) psychoactive effects, but also what health problems it can potentially be used for (and avoided). Moreover, the huge variety of cannabinoids and terpenoids gives cannabis a &#8220;multi-pronged&#8221; painkilling effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only does cannabis numb or distract the pain, but it also acts as an </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=The+endocannabinoid+system%3A+an+emerging+key+player+in+inflammation"><span style="font-weight: 400">anti-inflammatory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and helps people get to sleep and eat properly. In many ways, this makes cannabis superior to opioids when it comes to chronic pain &#8211; and </span><a href="http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/can.2017.0012"><span style="font-weight: 400">many people seem to agree</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><b>The Psychological Aspect</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You get up every morning, and you have to take a few pills. Then you have to take some more in the afternoon, but only 1 or 2 hours before or after you eat, and then some more in the evening, again 1 or 2 hours after you eat. This can be tiring and many people really don&#8217;t enjoy having to remember all the pills they have to take and when. Add to this physical addiction and lots of unwanted side-effects like cravings, nausea, irritability, restless legs, an inability to eat or sleep properly, emotional &#8220;numbness&#8221; and more besides, and you get the reasons why opioids, benzodiazepines and other such medications can be such a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">chore</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The overall psychological effects of taking these pharmaceutical cocktails can be devastating, and it&#8217;s not unusual for the side-effects for the treatment of pain to become as bad if not worse than the pain itself. Cannabis could potentially reduce the number of pills patients have to take, with only the most important ones becoming necessary. This also reduces the chances of negative cross-reactions with other medications, although we need to test cannabis&#8217;s interactions with other drugs and medications more thoroughly before we can say that for sure! However, it does seem that cannabis could be used to reduce pill intake, which is of massive benefit to the patients physically and psychologically.</span></p>

<p>It started in 2010 when Lindsey injured her back while on the job as a dog groomer in Texas. Seven years later, she was too high to work and &#8220;terrified of the withdrawal that I would have to go through.&#8221;</p>

<p>Health Canada issued a cannabis cultivation license for the 1.1 million-square-foot greenhouse operated by the joint venture of produce grower Village Farms International Inc. and medical cannabis firm Emerald Health Therapeutics Inc., the companies announced Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Growing any agricultural crop on a large scale and repeatedly delivering expected quantities and consistent quality, with full regulatory compliance, at a competitive price is an extremely challenging proposition for even the most experienced agricultural producers,&#8221; Michael DeGiglio, Village Farms&#8217; chief executive officer, said in a statement. &#8220;The goal is for the Joint Venture to set the standard in this regard in the Canadian cannabis industry and establish itself as a preferred supplier for both the short- and long-terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>The companies plan to immediately start growing cannabis in the Delta, British Columbia, greenhouse and set expectations to receive the sales license by July 1, 2018.</p>
<p>The facility that&#8217;s the size of about 19 football field is &#8220;conservatively&#8221; expected to produce 75,000 kilograms, or about 165,350 pounds, of cannabis annually.</p>
<p>And 1.1 million square feet of cannabis cultivation is just the beginning.</p>
<p>The British Columbia-based Village Farms plans to earmark another 3.7 million square feet of greenhouse space for cannabis cultivation, <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/07/27/canada-greenhouse-cannabis-cultivation-massachusetts/82609/">DeGiglio told The Cannabist last summer</a>, shortly after the joint venture was established.</p>

											    	<p>Cannabis and church: not two items that typically go together. But, in Denver, Amazing Grace Community Church and Lightshade dispensary are working to change that.</p>
<p>In December, as part of Lightshade&#8217;s corporate and local-level giving initiatives, the dispensary&#8217;s Federal Heights location partnered with neighboring Amazing Grace Community Church to give food to people in need. To do this, Lightshade supported the church&#8217;s food pantry as well as its bi-monthly meal service through financial contributions and volunteer hours. And starting in January, Lightshade agreed to fully fund the church&#8217;s food bank.</p>
<figure id="attachment_34675" style="max-width: 1920px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-34675" src="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Lightshade.jpg" alt="Lightshade: A Dispensary, a Church and an Unlikely Partnership" width="1920" height="700" srcset="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Lightshade.jpg 1920w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Lightshade-768x280.jpg 768w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Lightshade-770x281.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Lightshade crew serving up some food</figcaption></figure>
<p>It&#8217;s what most would consider an unlikely partnership, but one that is making a big difference in the Federal Heights community. It&#8217;s also a partnership that makes sense for both Amazing Grace Community Church and Lightshade.</p>
<p>It all started in 2011 with the creation of the Pastor&#8217;s Pantry as a way for Amazing Grace Community Church to help out local neighbors that needed food. From there, it quickly evolved into offering hot meals for free and, under its new name Dinner for a Dollar, feeds as many as 150 people each night.</p>
<p>However, its quick growth meant that it needed help, and that&#8217;s where Lightshade came in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our friends at Lightshade found out about these programs and sent representatives to a meal. An immediate partnership was forged, and Lightshade began to donate a portion of their profits to feed the hungry of the community,&#8221; explained Pastor Kent Replogle. &#8220;But their support did not stop there. Employees of Lightshade have come to the Dinner for a Dollar to serve and meet those that show up for dinner. These are people that really care about the community and once they have witnessed the need are willing to jump in and help out.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, that didn&#8217;t mean it was always an easy partnership. At first, the church and Pastor Kent were hesitant about accepting donations from a cannabis organization. But they quickly realized that accepting help from the cannabis industry wasn&#8217;t any different from accepting donations from a bar owner or an employee selling tobacco products. So, in the end, any concern was mitigated, especially after meeting and working with Lightshade.</p>
<p>&#8220;The donations from Lightshade are coming from a place of care and concern for those that are in need, and we have never been asked to publicize their donation from the pulpit of the church,&#8221; Pastor Kent said. &#8220;Lightshade filled a huge gap in our ability to serve those that are hungry. It takes over a thousand pounds of food a day to fill the hunger needs of this community, and the ability to get a sustainable food source is always a challenge. Through the gifts from Lightshade, we are coming closer to meeting those needs.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Taking care of our communities is very much a part of the cannabis culture.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As for Lightshade, working with Amazing Grace Community Church was a natural fit. They found the church through their partnership with <a href="http://kindcolorado.org/about-us/our-story/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">kindColorado</a>, an organization that connects communities and cannabis businesses to give back. Lightshade&#8217;s goal was to partner with a non-profit focused on hunger relief and who was ingrained in the community.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazing Grace checked the boxes and had little to no reservations about working with a business in the cannabis industry,&#8221; said Shannon Brooks, the VP of Marketing for Lightshade. &#8220;Pastor Kent is a kind and generous man, and a sincere pleasure to work with. He has accepted us with open arms and without judgment.&#8221;</p>

<p>So far, it&#8217;s been an incredible partnership. Beyond regular donations and volunteer hours, Lightshade teamed up with Amazing Grace Community Church to serve Thanksgiving dinner to those in need. And that&#8217;s just the start of how Lightshade makes a difference in their communities.</p>
<p>Giving back is a huge part of the Lightshade culture. They were the first Colorado dispensary to institute a Cannabis Social Responsibility program that looks for local initiatives to support, and they take their responsibilities seriously.</p>
<p>Lightshade has an ongoing partnership with The Gathering Place, a daytime drop-in center in Denver service women, children, and transgender individuals who experience extreme poverty or homelessness. Each month, Lightshade volunteers to pay for, serve, and clean up lunch for their members. They also work with their career center to help match members with open job positions within the cannabis industry. They&#8217;re also a major donor for The Gathering Place&#8217;s annual fundraiser.</p>
<figure id="attachment_34674" style="max-width: 1920px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="https://lightshade.com/lightshade-volunteers-gathering-place/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><img class="wp-image-34674 size-full" src="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/blog-gathering-place-01.jpg" alt="Lightshade: A Dispensary, a Church and an Unlikely Partnership" width="1920" height="1279" srcset="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/blog-gathering-place-01.jpg 1920w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/blog-gathering-place-01-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/blog-gathering-place-01-770x513.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Lightshade staff members, including the owners, prepped and served lunch to The Gathering Place members on Monday, November 6. It was a great experience to help such an inspiring organization.</figcaption></figure>
<p>In addition, Lightshade works with Grant Street Reach, Senior Support Services, Denver Urban Gardens, and Colorado Homeless Families. For each organization, Lightshade offers their time and funds to make a difference.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel that it is our duty to give back to the communities who have been so kind to allow us to conduct business as their neighbors,&#8221; Shannon explained. &#8220;We feel that it is important to be an integral part of the communities that we serve and to help elevate the collective good of its residents.&#160;We have skin in the game. In addition, we want to instill a spirit of giving in our employees by creating opportunities for them to engage in charitable work.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, while it might seem that a church and the cannabis industry have little in common, when it comes to helping those in need, they&#8217;re on the same page. &#8220;Taking care of our communities is very much a part of the cannabis culture,&#8221; said Shannon.</p>

<p>The Assembly Oversight Committee held the hearing in Trenton, with three additional meetings planned for the spring across the state.</p>
<p>The issue is front and center after <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/tag/phil-murphy/">Democrat Phil Murphy</a> won last year&#8217;s gubernatorial race while <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/16/phil-murphy-new-jersey-marijuana/96881/">campaigning for legalization</a>.</p>
<p>Despite Murphy&#8217;s support, some in the Democratic-led Legislature are questioning whether New Jersey should join the <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2016/10/14/legal-marijuana-laws-by-state-map-united-states/62772/">nine other states and the District of Columbia in legalization the drug</a>.</p>
<p>There was no specific bill under consideration on Monday, though legislators have introduced <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/06/26/new-jersey-legal-marijuana-christie/82392/">a measure that would legalize the recreational use of marijuana for those who are at least 21 years old</a>.</p>

<p>Advocates said legalization could <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/09/15/new-jersey-marijuana-legalization-democrats/88158/">boost state revenue and the economy</a>, help end a pot-fueled black market and reduce drug-related arrests. Opponents disputed those findings.</p>
<p>Lawmakers heard extensively from out-of-state officials, including <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/09/01/massachusetts-marijuana-board-finalized/87207/">Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commissioner Shaleen Title</a> and <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/tag/dan-pabon/">Democratic Colorado state Rep. Dan Pabon</a>.</p>
<p>Pabon said he voted against legalization in 2012, but has since changed his view, praising how his state focused on keeping marijuana away from children, criminals and drug cartels. He suggested that lawmakers begin keeping data on drug-related emergency room visits and so-called driving while drugged incidents, so New Jersey has a baseline of data if legalization moves forward.</p>
<p>Pabon said legalization comes down to getting support from a majority of people who will not use the drug but would benefit from the new tax revenues.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve gotta convince them this is a good use of taxpayers&#8217; dollars,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They just want to know where the taxes are going.&#8221;</p>

<hr>
<p>Former New Jersey State Police Superintendent Col. Rick Fuentes told lawmakers that he has concerns about legalization based on his meeting with a counterpart in Colorado, specifically citing <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/08/25/colorado-traffic-fatalities-marijuana-link/86767/">higher instances of driving while under the influence of drugs</a>.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Capt. Todd Raybuck said he has seen the &#8220;harmful impact&#8221; of legalization firsthand since Nevada legalized the drug last year.</p>
<p>The hearing at times hinged on emotional testimony from both sides.</p>
<p>Rob Cressen, a former state Republican Party official, backed legalization. Cressen suffers from complex regional pain syndrome and uses medical marijuana.</p>
<p>&#8220;Simply put it&#8217;s about liberty, the liberty for adults to make our own choices on how we medicate and how we recreate. Cannabis has saved me,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Luke Niforatos, an opponent and the chief of staff and senior policy adviser for <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/tag/smart-approaches-to-marijuana/">Smart Approaches to Marijuana</a>, which opposes legalization, said he and his wife left Colorado because of the drug. He said they were walking their 16-month-old daughter in Denver when they passed through a cloud of marijuana smoke and became concerned about her well-being.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has not been the panacea we were promised,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Medical <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a> is beneficial in the treatment of a number of neurological conditions, including <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/science/new-research-says-cannabis-can-treat-tourette-syndrome/">Tourette syndrome</a>. In recent years, researchers from all over the world have discovered that cannabis can calm the symptoms of this severe tic disorder. It is for this reason that the scientific minds of Australia are launching a study of medical marijuana and Tourette syndrome of their own. They believe cannabis could eventually replace the antipsychotic medications typically prescribed for these patients.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Wesley Medical Research Institute <a href="http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/medicinal-cannabis-trial-for-tourette-syndrome-patients-at-wesley/news-story/6fcf98fe66b3cd65a1ebe3b59c53281f" rel="nofollow">announced</a> a trial involving cannabis and Tourette syndrome. Neuropsychiatrist Philip Mosley will lead the study, which will consist of around 24 adult patients.</p>
<p>The goal of this limited exploration is to learn how marijuana, specifically the psychoactive and non-intoxicating compounds of the plant, can control the involuntary motor tics and verbalizations often experienced by those suffering from this affliction.</p>
<h2><strong>What Is Tourette Syndrome?</strong></h2>
<p>Tourette syndrome is a neurodevelopmental condition that develops in childhood. It is classified a tic disorder. People living with this condition experience many challenges. One of the hardest aspects of living with this disorder is that it can be difficult to maintain gainful employment and be socially active.</p>
<p>Of course, some cases are worse than others. The physical tics associated with Tourette syndrome can range from eye blinking to jaw movements.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>But for some, phonic tics, such as hooting and shouting, can cause more problems. According to <a href="https://www.tourette.org/about-tourette/overview/what-is-tourette/" rel="nofollow">Tourette Association of America</a>, 10-15 percent of the outbursts from vocal tics are obscene language.</p>
<p>This is called coprolalia. It is the most common portrayal of Tourette by the television and film industry.</p>
<h2><strong>Not Many Treatment Options for People With Tourette Syndrome</strong></h2>
<p>Tourette sufferers are traditionally prescribed antipsychotic medications. But these treatments are expensive and come with nasty side effects. The only other option is surgery. Medical experts claim that people with Tourette syndrome have had a great deal of success with this treatment.</p>
<p>But &#8220;not everyone wants to have brain surgery,&#8221; says Dr. Mosley.</p>
<p>Unlike similar studies, this one will focus on the application of <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/science/thc-tetrahydrocannabinol/">THC</a> and <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/cannabidiol-cbd/">CBD</a>. Although there has been a lot of focus recently on the medicinal value of CBD, which does not get patients high, Dr. Mosley suspects that &#8220;it&#8217;s a combination of the two [compounds] that will hit the sweet spot.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>He also believes that THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana, may be a secret weapon against this tic disorder. But the problem is that higher levels of this compound could bring on more anxiety in patients.</p>
<p>Many folks suffering from Tourette syndrome already have anxiety issues, so a more well-balanced <a href="https://hightimes.com/culture/the-ensemble-effect-not-the-entourage-effect-says-dr-grinspoon/">combination of the two cannabinoids</a> will likely work best.</p>
<h2><strong>Final Hit: Australia Launches Study of Medical Marijuana and Tourette Syndrome</strong></h2>
<p>The results of the study could show the medical community how cannabis can help people with Tourette syndrome. Dr. Mosley hopes the trial will be &#8220;beneficial for this condition,&#8221; and enable doctors to prescribe it with more confidence.</p>
<p>The study, which has been made possible through a $100,000 grant, is expected to get underway toward the middle of the year. Perhaps more studies involving medical marijuana and Tourette syndrome will follow.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking for maximum market exposure in cannabis, but no one was making packaging or scents or ingredients aimed at a multicultural audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founder&#8217;s Hemp teamed with a marketing and distribution company known for placing products before multicultural consumers.</p>
<p>The company, Segment Marketing Services of Winston-Salem, has plans to get Hemp Excellence products in barber shops and hair salons that serve customers of color.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have deep relationships in the community,&#8221; said Segment Marketing Services CEO&#160;Lafayette Jones, a former marketing executive at Proctor &amp; Gamble and Kraft Foods.</p>
<p>&#8220;The multiethnic populations in America are growing faster than any other. So if you&#8217;re an entrepreneur, you need to know this sector.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Limited CBD offerings</strong></p>
<p>The Hemp Excellence line contains only one product that contains cannabinoids, the CBD capsules.</p>
<p>The other Hemp Excellence products are made from hemp seed oil, in part to appeal to customers who may be hesitant to try cannabinoids.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are still a lot of people under the misconception that cannabinoids have to come from marijuana,&#8221; Crumley said.</p>
<p>Other CBD producers said the market potential for personal-care products aimed at women of color is huge but that producers have been slow to market themselves as ethnic products because they don&#8217;t want to be seen as stereotyping people.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still taboo in the Hispanic and African-American communities to be seen as embracing cannabis,&#8221; said Silvia Orizaba, founder of Sacred Mind &amp; Body.</p>
<p>The Northbrook, Illinois-based company makes personal-care products, including CBD, but doesn&#8217;t have a line aimed at women of color.</p>
<p>Orizaba told <em>Marijuana Business Daily</em> that ethnic minorities are &#8220;a little bit cautious when it comes to using products including cannabis and hemp.</p>
<p>&#8220;They feel sometimes that cannabis is only OK for white people. It&#8217;s going to take some time to penetrate that community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hemp Excellence had no initial sales figures from the North Carolina launch.</p>
<p>But Jones said the beauty-supply stores carrying the line have seen great interest from customers.</p>
<p>Hemp Excellence plans to launch hemp-oil hair-care products soon.</p>
<p>Hemp oil can help extend the life of both synthetic and human hair extensions, though no products currently on the market are aimed at the use, Jones said.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Enormous opportunity&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>According to market&#160;research firm Mintel, black consumers in the United States&#160;<a href="http://www.mintel.com/press-centre/beauty-and-personal-care/black-haircare-regimens-boost-shampoo-sales-in-the-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent more than $2.5 billion</a> on hair-care products in 2016.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s enormous opportunity here,&#8221; Jones said.</p>
<p>Roz McCarthy, head of the Florida advocacy group Minorities For Medical Marijuana, said she expects to see other hemp and CBD companies begin marketing to minorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a matter of having products aimed specifically at minorities; it&#8217;s about educating minorities about the benefits of the products that are already out there,&#8221; McCarthy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a learning gap when it comes to hemp and CBD, but I think you&#8217;ll see that change.&#8221;</p>

With U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions&#8217; rescission of the </span><a href="https://www.apnews.com/709665c7c40c441fbfd250238dadfed4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Cole Memo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, state industries face the concern that federal prosecutors will start enforcing cannabis regulations. The consumption, possession, cultivation, sale and distribution of cannabis is still illegal at the federal level. Just how much personal information is shared varies from state to state and even city to city.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">States collect personal information in different ways</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At your average California dispensary, residents must present their ID to prove they&#8217;re over the age of 21. Medical marijuana patients must also present their doctor&#8217;s recommendation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dispensaries will often photocopy these documents for their records or have visitors directly enter their information into a digital system &#8212; all while a security camera looks on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This type of detailed record keeping is often required by law; the extent of which is determined by the state agencies that create the recordkeeping rules. Often, this data is intended to measure the success of a program and ensure compliance with its regulations. Most often, regulatory agencies require data be taken at the point of sale, the results of which are reported in numbers and statistics &#8212; not individual purchasing information. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Colorado law mandates that recreational dispensaries keep </span><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/17/pot-shops-wary-of-privacy-concerns-in-handling-customer-information/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">recorded footage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for 40 days and allow state officials to inspect it as they please. In the event of a raid, these records could be confiscated and used as evidence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Arkansas is another medically legal state that&#8217;s strict with its reporting requirements. Dispensaries are banned from using promotion and marketing materials and are required to treat patient information as </span><a href="http://adh-staging.ark.org/images/uploads/pdf/The_Arkansas_Medical_Marijuana_Amendment_of_2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">confidential medical records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">In Oregon and Alaska, however, dispensaries simply take a look at a customers&#8217; ID to confirm they&#8217;re of legal age. Customers are free to wander inside the shop without offering any personal information, though they still have the option to sign up for the store&#8217;s email list and receive promotional discounts. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Do medical patients enjoy any federal protections?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">HIPAA protects patients&#8217; medical information </span><a href="https://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/the-truth-about-medical-marijuana-card-privacy/Content?oid=3426638" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">when they receive a medical marijuana recommendation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, but dispensaries and delivery services aren&#8217;t obligated to treat patient and customer information with the same discretion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tamar Todd of the </span><a href="http://www.politifact.com/california/article/2018/feb/13/how-much-privacy-do-you-have-when-you-buy-marijuan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Drug Policy Alliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> said the threat of a Federal crackdown on individuals is minimal. Additionally, the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment &#8212; called Rohrabacher-Blumenauer following the retirement of Senator Farr who originally co-authored the bill &#8212; prohibits the DOJ from prosecuting those who comply with state medical marijuana laws. These protections stick around so long as Congress chooses to renew the amendment every fiscal year. Thanks to bipartisan support, the amendment was reauthorized on Feb. 8.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No such federal-level policy exists to protect recreational users. It&#8217;s up to state regulatory measures to protect the average consumer&#8217;s privacy from both federal crackdowns and incursion by other interested parties. Some individual states have taken steps to protect customers&#8217; personal information. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">How are states protecting recreational users?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In April 2017, Oregon passed a law prohibiting dispensaries from keeping or sharing customer information. Oregon lawmakers </span><a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/marijuana/index.ssf/2017/04/oregon_lawmakers_vote_to_shiel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">passed the measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> citing fears that the Trump administration would crack down on cannabis consumers. Similar laws exist in Alaska, Colorado and Washington. Twenty five states with medical cannabis regulatory frameworks still lack such protections, some of which are also recreational states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Marijuana policy experts are skeptical that the federal authorities would spend the time and resources to target individual cannabis customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s very, very unlikely that there&#8217;s going to be targeting of individual customers. Many, many other targets would come first,&#8221; Todd told </span><a href="http://www.politifact.com/california/article/2018/feb/13/how-much-privacy-do-you-have-when-you-buy-marijuan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Politifact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>

<p>The committee only broke up after being warned by a reporter that their actions were breaking the state&#8217;s Open Meeting Law.</p>
<p>Members then voted to hold HB 577 in committee &#8212; a legislative procedure essentially halting the bill from moving forward.</p>

<p>Just hours after U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on Jan. 4 that federal prosecutors would be free to crack down on marijuana operations as they see fit, Jesse Arreguin, the mayor in Berkeley, California, summoned city councilman Ben Bartlett to his office with a novel idea.</p>
<p>Berkeley was already the first city in the nation to formally declare itself a sanctuary city on immigration, barring city officials from cooperating with federal authorities. Why not do the same thing with marijuana? Last month, <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/berkeley-declares-itself-a-sanctuary-city-for-cannabis-consumers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it did</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew we had to do something,&#8221; Bartlett said. &#8220;This is a new engine of a healthy economy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Others may soon follow Berkeley&#8217;s lead: Alaska, California and Massachusetts lawmakers are among those with similar bills pending, though the chances for passage is unclear.</p>
<p>Alaska state Rep. Adam Wool, who owns a movie, restaurant and concert venue with a liquor license in Fairbanks, said he introduced his bill as both a statement and a precaution.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the federal government wants to prosecute someone for breaking federal law, I guess they have every right to do that,&#8221; said Wool, a Democrat from one of Alaska&#8217;s major marijuana-growing areas. &#8220;I&#8217;m just saying, we will have no obligation to assist them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sessions&#8217; announcement invalidated a 2013 policy that allowed for legalized marijuana to flourish by limiting federal enforcement of the drug, as long as states prevented it from getting to places it was outlawed and kept it from gangs and children. His action also unsettled the industry and spooked potential marijuana industry investors. Marijuana is still illegal under federal law.</p>
<p>Casey O&#8217;Neill remembers helicopter enforcement raids of grow sites in California when he was growing up in the 1980s. It was then that his parents, carpenters who grew small amounts of cannabis, became school teachers, he said.</p>
<p>He now <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/industry/emerald-triangle-growers-scale-together-co-ops" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helps run a farm</a> that produces vegetables and marijuana for medical use near Laytonville, California, and is glad lawmakers are looking at ways to push back against the federal government.</p>
<p>Over the years, enforcement &#8220;has been uneven, we&#8217;ll say, and that&#8217;s kind of one of the things about it. It just means that everybody&#8217;s always afraid, and that&#8217;s hard,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/industry/emerald-triangle-growers-scale-together-co-ops"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/15094156/20170529_Oneil_051-web-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Emerald Triangle Growers Scale Up Together in Co-Ops</div></div></a></div>
<p>Dale Gieringer, director of California NORML, a marijuana advocacy group, said California has a lousy history with the federal government on marijuana enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the feds care too much about marijuana in Alaska, to tell you the truth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But marijuana has been a big industry in this state, so we&#8217;re sort of on the front lines.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no apparent panic in the industry over Sessions&#8217; change in policy, given limited federal resources and prosecutors having had discretion in bringing cases all along. But there isn&#8217;t complacency, either.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the federal government is going to effectively step in and wipe us out of business. I just find that hard to believe at this point. But they can make it hard for us,&#8221; said Jennifer Canfield, who co-owns a state-licensed marijuana cultivation operation and retail store in Alaska&#8217;s capital city, Juneau.</p>

<p>Peter Mlynarik, a police chief in Soldotna, Alaska, called the Alaska bill a terrible idea. He asked what would happen if a local agency were helping the federal government on a heroin bust but also found marijuana in the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s crazy to put that burden on, especially, police officers that are supposed to obey federal laws,&#8221; said Mlynarik, who resigned from Alaska&#8217;s marijuana regulatory board after Sessions&#8217; actions in January, saying it stripped the underpinning for the state&#8217;s legal marijuana industry.</p>
<p>Morgan Fox, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, said he can&#8217;t see federal agents raiding businesses that are complying with state law.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t put it past them,&#8221; he said, adding that new U.S. attorneys have been appointed by President Donald Trump in many states. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t put it past at least a few of them to want to gain points with their boss.

Blood</strong></p>
<p>LOS ANGELES (<em>AP</em>) &#8212; American Indian tribes that say they have been cut out of California&#8217;s legal marijuana market have raised the possibility of going their own way by establishing pot businesses outside the state-regulated system that is less than two months old.</p>
<p>The tribes floated the idea of setting up rival farms and sales shops on reservations after concluding that rules requiring them to be licensed by the state would strip them of authority over their own lands and their right to self-governance.</p>
<p>The possibility of the tribes breaking away from the state-run system is one more challenge for California as it attempts to transform its longstanding medicinal and illegal marijuana markets into a unified, multibillion-dollar industry.</p>
<p>For tribes to participate in the state-run market, &#8220;they have to give up their rights to act as governments, with regard to cannabis,&#8221; said Mark Levitan, a tribal attorney.</p>
<p>At issue are legally thorny questions about who governs whom, taxation and the intersection of state marijuana laws with tribes that the federal government recognizes as sovereign nations within the U.S.</p>
<p>Under regulations issued last year, California would retain full control over licensing. Tribes would have to follow state rules, including &#8220;submission to all enforcement,&#8221; to obtain a license to grow or sell marijuana. Any application must include a waiver of &#8220;sovereign immunity,&#8221; a sort of legal firewall that protects tribal interests.</p>
<p>Without state licenses, businesses cannot take part in the legal state pot market. California has over 100 federally recognized tribes, the most of any state, and estimates of the number either growing and selling pot or eager to do so varies, from a handful to over 20.</p>
<p>Unlike those that have prospered from casino gambling, some are in struggling rural areas and would welcome a new source of cash to improve schools and pave roads.</p>
<p>After long-running negotiations between tribes and state officials failed to produce an agreement before broad legal sales began Jan. 1, the California Native American Cannabis Association warned state officials that tribes &#8220;may engage in commercial cannabis activities through our own inherent sovereign authority.&#8221;</p>
<p>If tribes choose to step away from California&#8217;s market, &#8220;the state will have no jurisdiction to enforce its cannabis laws and regulations on tribal lands,&#8221; the group said in a sharply worded letter to Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown&#8217;s administration in December.</p>
<p>Tribes &#8220;just want to be able to do business in the state of California and elsewhere, just like anybody else,&#8221; said Paul Chavez, former chairman of the Bishop Paiute tribe.</p>
<p>The dispute in California differs from another legal pot state, Washington, where seven tribes have marijuana compacts with the state and others are in negotiations or awaiting the governor&#8217;s approval. The compacts allow tribal marijuana businesses to participate in the legal system, such as selling tribe-grown pot to retailers off the reservation.</p>
<p>In California, the tribes are circulating a proposal that calls for the governor to strike agreements with them. Those pacts would allow them to participate in the legal market, while the state would recognize a tribe&#8217;s &#8220;exclusive authority&#8221; to regulate commercial marijuana activity on its lands.</p>
<p>Tribes are eager for a settlement, but reaching a deal in the Legislature could take the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone agrees conceptually there should be an even playing field, a level playing field,&#8221; said state Assemblyman Rob Bonta, a Democrat at the center of the negotiations in Sacramento.</p>
<p>In addition to the problems in Sacramento, tribes are facing uncertainty at the federal level.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions lifted an Obama-era policy that kept federal authorities from cracking down on the marijuana trade in states where the drug is legal, which also guided enforcement on tribal lands.</p>
<p>The shifting ground has put a chill over development plans &#8212; including in an isolated stretch of eastern San Diego County.</p>
<p>Nevada-based GB Sciences Inc. announced last year that it would build and manage a commercial cannabis company on tribal lands, nurturing plants, manufacturing products and distributing them across the state.</p>
<p>The tribe, the Los Coyotes Band of Cahuilla and Cupeno Indians, would get an ownership stake, jobs and 40 percent of the profits. GB Sciences would get income for its marijuana research and a foothold in the largest legal pot market in the U.S.</p>
<p>But the projected $8 million project is on hold, with the status of tribes in the pot market unclear.</p>
<p>Issues involving sovereignty touch a sensitive subject for tribes, and they see the predicament with marijuana as part of a history of exploitation.</p>
<p>The state rule &#8220;harkens back to the end of the 19th century &#8230; when federal and state policies favored extermination or forced assimilation of California tribes,&#8221; the tribal group wrote.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that medicinal <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> legal in 29 states and recreational pot is permitted in nine states and the District of Columbia, there is still discrimination amongst its legal users, especially amongst educational institutions.

<p>However, it appears one university has taken their anti-marijuana stance to a whole new level.</p>
<h2>The Rejection</h2>
<p>Texas Wesleyan University, a private school in Forth Worth, remains in hot water after an e-mail, sent by their longtime baseball coach Mike Jeffcoat, went viral earlier in the week.</p>
<p>In the letter, the coach notified a potential recruit that the school would not be accepting any prospective students from Colorado, a state synonymous with the term &#8220;recreational marijuana.&#8221; The university&#160;confirmed the e-mail on Wednesday.</p>

<p>The e-mail was, unsurprisingly, met with an enormous amount of backlash. The university&#8217;s vice president for marketing and communications,&#160;John Veilleux, sent a statement to the Chronicle, acknowledging&#160;the coach&#8217;s wrongdoing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re definitely aware of the email sent out by our baseball coach and the comments he made are in no way a reflection of Texas Wesleyan University, its values or its recruiting practices,&#8221; Veilleux said in the statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a personnel matter and it is currently under investigation,&#8221; he told the paper. &#8220;We follow due process here. It is our university policy to not discuss personnel matters.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>The university&#160;also released a formal apology on their website, which was subsequently shared on the school&#8217;s Twitter account:</p>

<p>The status of Jeffcoat, who has coached the team since 2002, and is the baseball program&#8217;s all-time leader in wins with a 529-358-1 record, remains up-in-the-air.</p>
<p>The university&#160;plans to do a full investigation of the matter, but it&#8217;s clear his discriminating e-mail could result in the former major leaguer losing his job.</p>
<p>Several irate people took to Twitter, calling for the termination of Jeffcoat.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t condone discrimination, fire your baseball coach. Otherwise, yes, yes, you do,&#8221; one Twitter user said.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>&#8220;Actions speak louder than words. What your coach did is discrimination. I hope you are smart enough to understand you need to fire the coach. I hope the kid sues the school,&#8221; another added.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what TWU plans to do with Jeffcoat at the moment, but with more and more states legalizing the plant both <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/pennsylvania-start-medical-marijuana-sales-week/">medically</a> and<a href="https://hightimes.com/news/legalization/will-new-jersey-be-next-state-legalize-marijuana/"> recreationally</a>, it&#8217;s unlikely they&#8217;ll even be able to field a team with their current coach&#8217;s ideologies.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t that be ironic?</p>

											    	<h4>Hops-Infused Cannabis Vapes by Lagunitas and AbsoluteXtracts</h4>
<p>We&#8217;ve talked about cannabis-infused beer, but imagine vaping hops-infused cannabis! SuperCritical is the first craft cannabis and hops vape cartridge, brought to you by a partnership between CannaCraft (home of AbsoluteXtracts) and Lagunitas Brewing. CannaCraft and Lagunitas are a natural fit; both are located in Sonoma County and embody California&#8217;s adventurous spirit. The collaboration came about quite organically, through Lagunitas&#8217; practice of vaping hops in a volcano vaporizer to assess their aromatic properties. Lagunitas wanted to design a more convenient way to vape hops in cartridge format for on the go, which led to the grand idea of replacing cannabis terpenes with hop terpenes in a vapeable cartridge. Enter the SuperCritical vape cartridge, named after CannaCraft&#8217;s carbon dioxide extraction technique and Critical Solutions&#8217; extraction machines. There are two flavors currently available: Hop Cannon, a dank, hoppy, IPA-style and Stereoterpical, a bright, crisp, citrusy ale.</p>

<p>It turns out cannabis and hops have a lot in common, which the DOPE team discussed with Lagunitas and CannaCraft as we poured over a phylogeny printout that mapped genus, phylum and species evolution of the two plants from their common root. Cannabis (weed) and humulus (hops), the two plants&#8217; scientific names, are not only in the same botanical phylum&#8212;they are of the same family, and very closely related. Most plants make terpenes, which deliver scent and flavor, but cannabis and hops in particular create a multitude of terpenes and share their respective dominant terpenes. Jeremy Marshall, Head Brewmaster at Lagunitas, says all this science was &#8220;in the back of our minds, but it didn&#8217;t necessarily drive us [to create the partnership]. We just wanted to trade terps and smoke weed and drink beer together as a family! But there&#8217;s also a scientific reason we&#8217;re hanging out.&#8221;</p>
<p>Marshall went on to explain that our sense of smell is our most primal sense, tying us to our animalistic self. Smell bypasses the thinking brain and goes straight to the limbic system, which is tied to our emotions, memories, fight or flight and basic survival responses. Because we experience terpenes via our sense of smell, it&#8217;s tied to something primal deep within us. This idea spurred a fascinating conversation between Marshall and &#8220;Jigga,&#8221; Master Cannabis Breeder and CannaCraft family cultivation partner, as they traded terpene notes.</p>
<figure id="attachment_34501" style="max-width: 1296px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-34501" src="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Rosales_NorthBayFires4_09-1-of-1.jpg" alt="Hops-Infused Cannabis Vapes by Lagunitas and AbsoluteXtracts&#160;" width="1296" height="864" srcset="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Rosales_NorthBayFires4_09-1-of-1.jpg 1296w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Rosales_NorthBayFires4_09-1-of-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Rosales_NorthBayFires4_09-1-of-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Rosales_NorthBayFires4_09-1-of-1-770x513.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1296px) 100vw, 1296px"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Hops-Infused Cannabis Vapes by Lagunitas and AbsoluteXtracts</figcaption></figure>
<p>Marshall describes how he&#8217;s always finding things in nature and sending those ideas to his breeder to recreate the essence of his new discoveries. As he notes various scents and tastes, Jigga makes a smacking sound with his lips, which prompts Marshall to quip, &#8220;I love it when he does that!&#8221; Marshall then describes how he selected his favorite cannabis strain to match Lagunitas&#8217; hops, underlining how important the terpenes&#8217; synergy is in his process: &#8220;I sniffed every terp in the lab and landed on [the] Girl Scout Cookies&#8221; strain (of which Jigga happens to be the originator) to produce the SuperCritical Ale. Jigga melted our heartstrings when he revealed he&#8217;s &#8220;here to pay homage to the plant; I&#8217;m a servant to her.&#8221; And he was thrilled to learn that DOPE stands for just that: Defending Our Plant Everywhere.</p>
<p>Jigga and Marshall encouraged us to get the most out of the beer and cannabis pairing experience by sipping a Lagunitas beer, followed by a smooth inhalation of the SuperCritical vape, exhaling through the nose, then drinking a sip of warm water to open up the &#8220;retro-sensory&#8221; experience. The DOPE team was gifted with SuperCritical vape cartridges and conducted our own quality checks. These new hops-infused weed vapes pass with flying colors!</p>

<p>Denver County Court Judge Fred Rodgers declared a mistrial for <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/04/12/international-church-of-cannabis-elevationists-denver-social-use-law/77127/">International Church of Cannabis</a> founders Steve Berke, Lee Molloy and Briley Hale after city prosecutors decided they couldn&#8217;t seat a six-person jury.</p>
<p>The three defendants each face a misdemeanor charge of open and public consumption of marijuana and violating the Colorado Clean Indoor Act. They were issued citations following an April 20, 2017 undercover Denver Police sting conducted during their church&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/04/21/international-church-of-cannabis-denver-420-debut-public-consumption/78098/">private, invitation-only 4/20 celebration</a> at which many of the 200-plus attendees smoked marijuana in designated consumption areas.</p>
<p>The municipal case is being prosecuted in Denver County Court so city attorneys can argue that the three church leaders were complicit in fostering open and public consumption of marijuana by those attending the event.</p>
<p>Of the 21 people called for the six-person jury, one was dismissed for a medical condition and two were dismissed when they said their stance on marijuana precluded them from upholding the jurors&#8217; oath. Seven of the remaining 18 in the pool were challenged for cause during the two-hour selection process that saw four potential jurors openly questioned Senior Assistant City Attorney Rebekah Watada&#8217;s theory of the case.</p>
<p>With the larger county court juror pool having been released for the day, and with neither side willing to relinquish their three preemptory challenges allowing each legal team to dismiss jurors deemed unacceptable, just five possible jurors remained and a mistrial was declared.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never seen that,&#8221; the defendants&#8217; attorney Warren C. Edson said of the array of people that questioned the prosecution&#8217;s legal theory during jury selection. &#8220;Hopefully this is a wake-up call for the city that this (case) isn&#8217;t the open-and-shut matter that they think that it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>One member of the jury pool questioned why seven police detectives were on the prosecution&#8217;s witness list for a misdemeanor marijuana case.</p>
<p>Another said he didn&#8217;t think tax dollars should be spent prosecuting such cases.</p>
<p>Still another perspective juror said she struggled to understand why the city was pursing the complicity argument when she had witnessed Denver police officers ignore open and public consumption of marijuana in city venues.</p>
<p>&#8220;Have you ever been to Red Rocks?&#8221; she asked Watada.</p>
<p>Following the declaration of a mistrial, the defendants waived their right to a speedy trial, and a new date was set for July 11.</p>
<p>Watada asked the judge to request a 50-person pool from which to select the six-member jury for the next go-around. She declined to comment about the ongoing case.</p>
<p>The new trial will take place nearly 15 months after two undercover Denver Police detectives breached The International Church of Cannabis&#8217;s private, invitation-only 4/20 festivities. The church at 400 S. Logan St. is the headquarters of Elevation Ministries, a Colorado nonprofit religious organization that claims cannabis as its primary sacrament.</p>
<p>To date, there have been at least six hearings on the case, Edson said.</p>
<p>Though each of the three defendants faces two misdemeanor charges, the case could set an important precedent for Colorado&#8217;s cannabis laws, Edson said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2012/11/06/coloradans-say-yes-to-recreational-use-of-marijuana/">Amendment 64</a>, the voter-approved constitutional measure that legalized marijuana in 2012, states that personal marijuana use is allowed by adults 21 and older except when &#8220;conducted openly and publicly or in a manner that endangers others.&#8221;</p>
<p>As the state approaches five years of legal recreational marijuana sales, open and public consumption has yet to be defined by the state&#8217;s Task Force on the Implementation of Amendment 64, the Legislature or in the courts.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is, I think, the first time we&#8217;re going to have a jury decide what is open and public (consumption),&#8221; Edson said. &#8220;We have case law about what&#8217;s open, and we have case law about what&#8217;s public, but we don&#8217;t have a case law about what&#8217;s both. And that&#8217;s big.&#8221;</p>
<p>While a conviction in the municipal case imposes a maximum penalty of just $300, Edson said a it could have dire consequences for his clients and their nascent church.</p>
<p>Public consumption is a nuisance crime in Denver, he said, so a conviction allows the city to file forfeiture papers on the church property.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s where this is heading,&#8221; he said when asked why the city was pursuing the case with such zeal.</p>
<p>Outside the courtroom, Berke said that the undercover police sting, charges brought against him and his cohorts and ongoing prosecution constitute religious persecution. He also vowed to mobilize the church&#8217;s 2,000-plus Denver metro-area members to hold local politicians accountable for police resources and tax dollars being used for marijuana prosecutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;This entire circus is a travesty,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Is a rise in pedestrian deaths really due to legal <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a>? A traffic story published earlier this week says that just might be the case.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ghsa.org/sites/default/files/2018-03/pedestrians_18.pdf" rel="nofollow">study</a>, published by the Governors&#8217; Highway Safety Association, compiled records on pedestrian fatalities over a 10 year period. During that time, pedestrian deaths rose 27 percent. All other traffic&#160;fatalities actually decreased 14 percent during the same time.</p>
<p>The author of the study, traffic safety engineer Richard Retting, cited many possible causes for the dramatic increase. Cell phone use, increases in both walking and driving, and better economic conditions were all suggested as potential causes for the rise in deaths.</p>
<p>The ratio of pedestrian&#160;deaths to vehicle occupant deaths is also increasing. Improved safety technology in cars and trucks is reducing injuries and deaths for drivers and passengers.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>Is Pot to Blame?</h2>
<p>The study noted an interesting fact about the data from states with legal pot.</p>
<p>&#8220;The seven states (Alaska, Colorado, Maine, Massachusettes, Nevada, Oregon, Washington) and DC that legalized recreational use of marijuana between 2012 and 2016 reported a collective 16.4 percent increase in pedestrian traffic fatalities for the first six months of 2017 versus the first six of 2016, whereas all other states reported a collective 5.8 percent decrease in pedestrian fatalities.&#8221;</p>
<p>The study did not mention whether high drivers, walkers or a combination of the two could be to blame. Retting was clear to point out that the report was not making a direct correlation or expressly claiming a link between weed and walking deaths.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not making a definitive, cause-and-effect link to marijuana,&#8221; Retting <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/business/pedestrian-deaths-marijuana.html" rel="nofollow">told The New York Times</a>. He did add that the information &#8220;is a marker for concern. It may be a canary in a coal mine, an early indicator to address.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Other Potential Causes</h2>
<p>The report also highlighted the use of cell phones as a possible cause of the increase.</p>
<p>&#8220;With regard to cell phone use, the reported number of smartphones in active use in the U.S. increased by 236 percent from 2010 to 2016, and the annual number of multimedia messages over this period more than tripled.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Analysis of data from the National Electronic Injury Surveillance database shows the number of cell phone related emergency department visits is increasing in parallel with the prevalence of cell phone use in the United States.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additionally, the National Highway Traffic Administration has estimated distractions are a factor in 10 percent of fatal car crashes.</p>
<p>Retting&#8217;s report also noted that many other things can impact the number of collisions and resulting deaths. Relatively low fuel prices, good weather, and better economic conditions all translate into more miles driven and walked.</p>
<p>These factors, although out of the control of traffic safety engineers and law enforcement, can still impact the number of fatalities on U.S. roads and sidewalks.</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;Is A Rise In Pedestrian Deaths Really Due To Legal Cannabis?</h2>
<p>Whatever the cause, the rise in pedestrian traffic fatalities is alarming. Huge increases in 2015 and 2016 and similar numbers in 2017 have resulted in a disturbing trend.</p>
<p>The GHSA report noted that &#8220;it has been more than 25 years since the U.S. experienced this level of pedestrian fatalities.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>Hemp fiber and oil can be used in numerous products. Federal drug law doesn&#8217;t differentiate between hemp and its cousin marijuana, but Congress in 2014 began allowing states to conduct research pilot programs.</p>
<p>Thirty-one states have. Wisconsin lawmakers lifted a ban on the crop last fall.</p>

<p>KTVN-TV reported Tuesday that if revenue from pot sales continues at this pace, it will leave extra money for the budget.</p>
<p>Will Adler, Director of the Sierra Cannabis Coalition, said the industry is fitting quite well into the state&#8217; economy.</p>

<p>The tax money the industry brings in goes to different places. Most of the 10 percent retail tax revenue goes to the state&#8217;s rainy day fund, while the 15 percent wholesale tax helps fund the Department of Taxation, local jurisdictions and education.</p>
<p>The Legislative Commission has approved permanent regulations for recreational marijuana sales, so the industry&#8217;s money will soon begin to be distributed.</p>

The January study cited consumption of outdoor cannabis that contained Coccidioides Immitis fungus as the source of the infection.</p>
<p>According to a case study <a href="http://casereports.bmj.com/content/2018/bcr-2017-221435.html">published</a> in January&#8217;s British Medical Journal, a 48-year-old woman and cannabis patient who smoked up to six blunts a day had been suffering from dizziness, tiredness, could not remember her name and was behaving aggressively. After a few weeks, the doctors identified a coccidioidomycosis infection as the cause, but it was unclear how the patient had become infected.</p>
<p>In some regions of California, the fungus Coccidioides Immitis is present in the soil. This fungus species can cause Coccidioidomycosis, commonly known as Cocci, Valley fever, California fever or desert rheumatism, in humans. When plants are cultivated in soil where this fungus is present, the spores inevitably end up on the plant.</p>
<p>To confirm their suspicion, the researchers took samples from the patient&#8217;s dispensary in <a href="http://www.bakersfield.com/news/health/state-data-could-be-worst-year-for-valley-fever-in/article_e047a066-c8c4-11e7-b6c8-974f11d72aad.html">Bakersfield</a>. More than 90 percent of the marijuana plants tested were contaminated with pesticides, and crops from 20 farms were tested positive for mold.</p>
<p>In most of the women&#8217;s preferred outdoor strains, researchers found Coccidioides Immitis spores in three out of nine samples. Researchers also found instances of &#160;Cryptococcus neofarns. The investigating doctors said it is possible that fungal spores can survive the burning that occurs when patients smoke the herb.</p>
<p>This is not the first time concerns of mold and other contaminants have been raised, but until this case, it was suspected that only people with a suppressed immune system could be infected by smoking fungus-contaminated medical cannabis. This is the first documented case of a person with an intact immune system being infected by inhaling cannabis contaminated with Coccidioides Immitis.</p>
<p>Asked about the consequences for patients, the woman&#8217;s treating MD and conductor of the study, Dr. Bryan Sharpiro told the <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/health/article-5327367/California-woman-caught-meningitis-CANNABIS.html">Daily Mail.</a></p>
<p>&#8220;Make sure you know where your marijuana is coming from. I recommend buying indoor-grown strains and, for people who are immuno-compromised like those with HIV or other infections, I would recommend avoiding inhaled marijuana products. Edible products, on the other hand, are probably safer for consumption.&#8221;</p>
<h2>How do I know if my cannabis is contaminated?</h2>
<p>Many US states with medical marijuana laws have<a href="https://weedmaps.com/learn/lab-testing/"> lab analysis</a> requirements in place to ensure the product being served to the patients is free of contaminants, including pesticides, mold and other residual products. California&#8217;s recreational rollout this year included lab testing requirements that were not heavily enforced prior to legalization.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether or not a state requires a lab test, verifying the cleanliness of medicinal cannabis is important to patient health.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Bonni Goldstein, M.D. is a </span><a href="https://www.createspace.com/6749195"><span style="font-weight: 400">published author</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and physician who specializes in cannabis medicine in Los Angeles. In her professional opinion, the dangers these products pose to consumers and the industry is significant. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Patients who are already struggling with serious medical conditions don&#8217;t need additional issues with their medicine,&#8221; Goldstein told Marijuana.com in a previous interview. &#8220;They shouldn&#8217;t have to worry that the products they use are counterfeit or contaminated. Dispensaries are in the business of helping medical patients find the medicine that will help them and it&#8217;s incumbent on them to screen for counterfeit products and only offer quality tested products.&#8221;</span></p>

<hr>
<p>The days are getting longer and the sun is coming out, which means it&#8217;s high time for a sativa-dominant New Strains Alert! This week, we added some delicious up-and-coming crosses, including two <a href="https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/thin-mint">GSC Thin Mint</a> mash-ups, two new OG crosses, Princess (parent of the wonderful <a href="https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/cinderella-99">Cinderella 99</a>), and many more!</p>
<p>Meanwhile Tangie Cookies inherits the stout structure and trichome production of GSC Thin Mint combined with the astoundingly fruity flavor of Tangie. Gorilla Girl is a combination of two modern cannabis celebrities, GSC Thin Mint x GG (f.k.a. Gorilla Glue). Both of its parent strains have dense, resin-packed buds, and those attributes are amplified through this marriage of cannabis cultivars.</p>
<p>Be sure to also take a moment to pop by <a href="https://www.leafly.com/finder">your favorite dispensary</a> menu and check out the recently released menu overhaul! And as always, if you&#8217;ve had the pleasure of&#160; trying any of these unique genetics, leave a review and help inform the community.</p>

<p>Tangie Cookies by Elev8 Seeds was a no-brainer cross of excellent genetics. Created by crossing&#160;<a href="https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/thin-mint">GSC Thin Mint</a>&#160;and&#160;<a href="https://www.leafly.com/sativa/tangie">Tangie</a>, this dense, resin-clad bud expresses a loud orange peel aroma. The plant is rather vigorous, offering a generous yield over its 10-week flowering cycle. Tangie Cookies is an extremely potent strain that has been known to produce a terpene profile that can reach 3-5%. Enjoy the stimulating and uplifting effects of Tangie Cookies outdoors or among friends to get the most out of this fine, flavorful flower.</p>

<p><strong>Is It Worth the High?</strong><br>
Eh, I&#8217;d rather get high and watch something else. This is definitely not worth the high. Like&#8230;it&#8217;s cool, but that&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s one of those movies you wouldn&#8217;t mind watching on TNT while bored during a snow day, but going to the theater isn&#8217;t worth it at all. Tom Hanks has been on a string of really good yet really regular movies lately, and not even Queen Meryl could change that. Save your money and your bud and go see something else.</p>
<p><strong>Which Character Needed Cannabis the Most?<br>
</strong>Katherine Graham, owner of the Washington Post. Running a newspaper is hard enough, but imagine being the first female publisher of a newspaper that&#8217;s constantly getting its ass kicked by the New York Times. Now imagine all of that topped with a scandal and war with the federal government over the Pentagon Papers. Everything I just said spells out nothing but stress, so Kat definitely needed some THC relaxation.</p>

YESSSSSSSSS. <em>LADY BIRD</em> IS SOOOO GOOD. It&#8217;s funny, it&#8217;s touching, it&#8217;s a beautiful look into the life of a young woman who aspires for something greater than what her surroundings can deliver at this stage of her life.

</strong>Marion McPherson. Dog, could Lady Bird&#8217;s mom be any more frustrating? My god. Someone get her a couple dabs so she can melt her brain and chill out a little bit. She was the most high-strung character out of any character in any movie on this list, and <em>Dunkirk</em>&#8217;s whole cast was literally just sitting and waiting for bombs to be dropped on their faces. Lady Bird&#8217;s mom needs to see a doctor immediately and discuss which strain or cannabis products could help with her stress, anxiety, and mood. Sheesh.</p>

<p><strong>Is It Worth the High?</strong><br>
Absolutely. It was the most original and had the biggest cultural impact of anything up for the award. <em>Get Out</em> was scary, funny, engaging, educational, and overall the most complete movie of the year, in my opinion. It&#8217;s an instant classic, and because of it we&#8217;ll be using the term &#8220;The Sunken Place&#8221; for the rest of eternity. So yes, it&#8217;s definitely worth the high.</p>
<p><strong>Which Character Needed Cannabis the Most?&#160;</strong><br>
Jeremy Armitage (Allison Williams&#8217; character&#8217;s brother). This kid was way too high-strung and spazzy. He immediately came through and wanted to put Chris through the NFL combine, and it&#8217;s like bro, can you sit back and relax? Had Jeremy had a solo joint session, he would&#8217;ve had the time to sit back and realize how ridiculous his obsession with black athletes was.</p>

It is and it isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s a good movie, but with <em>Darkest Hour</em> being so relative to <em>Dunkirk</em>, I feel like you&#8217;re good watching one or the other. And if it were up to me, I&#8217;d go <em>Darkest Hour</em> over <em>Dunkirk</em>.</p>

Hell yeah. It&#8217;s really good. It&#8217;s one of those movies with a noir feel that keeps you engaged because the acting is so good that you really believe you&#8217;re witnessing the story the way it really played out in history. I only watched it because of obligation, but I was fairly pleased with it.</p>

Son, this movie was fire. It was strange at times, but it was definitely fire. The main character being mute added an element that I&#8217;ve never seen in a film, and the directing was incredibly great, too (shoutout to Guillermo Del Toro).</p>
<p><strong>Which Character Needed Cannabis the Most?&#160;</strong><br>
Zelda Fuller. Olivia Spencer&#8217;s character is&#160;just a black woman trying to make it in a hostile work environment. All she wants to do is clock in, clean up, and go home to her dumbass husband. But she can&#8217;t because Eliza wants to fall in love with the scientist alien from <em>Hellboy</em> and shit. And then Strickland wants to pop up her doorstep and punk her husband in her home? She definitely needs some cannabis in her life just so she can get super high and slide into autopilot for the rest of her days.</p>

<p><strong>Is It Worth the High?</strong><br>
This is probably the most debated movie out of the list of Best Picture nominees. I liked it, but it&#8217;s definitely one of those movies whose premise was better than the execution. It keeps you engaged and ready for a big moment that simply never comes. The last scene of the movie&#8230;like&#8230;it just ends. It&#8217;s a scene that you think will lead to some resolution, and the next thing you know you&#8217;re watching the credits roll. So honestly, it probably isn&#8217;t worth your cannabis if your other options are everything else on this list.</p>
<p><strong>Which Character Needed Cannabis the Most?&#160;</strong><br>
Red Welby. The man got thrown out of a window and broke his legs and body. So you know he&#8217;s in an incredible amount of pain, and hospitals usually prescribe an abundant amount of pain pills that lead to crippling addictions. Instead, get Red Welby some high-CBD strains and let his pain be treated with a safer and more natural option. Red Welby is a prime example of a should-be medical marijuana patient.</p>

ABSOLUTELY. IT IS PHENOMENAL. It&#8217;s one of those movies that if you clapped in the theater, I wouldn&#8217;t even think, &#8220;Wow, this person is the worst. I hate them.&#8221; The story of an obsessive dressmaker who treats everyone around him like shit until he falls in love with a woman who&#8217;s simply too much for him? Give it to me. Daniel-Day Lewis is amaaaazing in this.</p>

Cyril Woodcock. She&#8217;s the only character in the entire film that HAS to stick by Woodcock&#8217;s side as his sister. But that doesn&#8217;t make the job/life any less stressful; you could tell she was totally fed up with his shit after putting in the kind of hours it took to be his sidekick.

Elio. That fireplace scene at the end of the movie? MAN. That young boy was completely heartbroken, and getting stoned would be the perfect distraction for him. I suggest a heavy indica so he can just pass right out afterward.</p>

<p>The punishment for <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> use and distribution in the United States is criticized for how harsh it has been for decades. However, there are countries where the punishment for getting caught with weed is far worse. For example, in South Korea, cannabis is treated the same as any other illicit drug and you can be imprisoned for having traces of marijuana in your system from before you came to the country. If you think that&#8217;s bad, did you know you can be killed for weed in these countries listed below?</p>

<p>It shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise that the drug laws are strict in China. But getting caught with a small amount of weed in China won&#8217;t result in your death.</p>

<p>Southeast Asian governments have some of the toughest drug laws on the planet. Myanmar is no exception.</p>
<p>In fact, a vegetable seller named Nur Alam Mohd Hussain was found guilty of possessing five pounds of cannabis which he said was &#8220;fictitious.&#8221;</p>
<p>The sentence he was given was death, which would be the first death sentence for drugs in Myanmar in the last ten years.</p>
<p>According to Hussain, he was making a delivery for a third person when police surrounded him at a gas station. He claims he thought the envelopes given to him were holding stolen car parts.</p>
<p>However, Myanmar authorities weren&#8217;t buying it. They say he should have been able to smell 5 pounds.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.nst.com.my/news/2017/01/207569/myanmar-vegetable-seller-sentenced-death-cannabis-trafficking" rel="nofollow">New Straits Times</a>, by not reporting it, &#8220;it can be concluded that he had knowledge that the cannabis was for trafficking.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saudi Arabia is known for its harsh drug laws. You can be killed for weed possession as well as for other drugs.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, a couple of Yemeni citizens were <a href="http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2016/Feb-17/337724-saudi-executes-two-yemeni-drug-traffickers.ashx?utm_content=bufferab228&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=buffer" rel="nofollow">reportedly executed</a>&#160;for smuggling hash into the country. Hash is a potent form of cannabis made from compressing cannabis resin.</p>
<p>They were beheaded for their crime and the country has a history of executing people over drug offenses. So we wouldn&#8217;t recommend riding dirty in Saudi Arabia.</p>
<h2>Final Hit: You Can Be Killed For Weed In These Countries</h2>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t have the amount of weight on you to warrant a death sentence, <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/world/countries-strictest-weed-laws/">many countries have&#160;strict weed laws</a>. You can face extended prison time or deportation for getting caught with personal amounts of weed in certain countries.</p>
<p>So make sure you research the weed laws of any country before visiting. We don&#8217;t recommend buying, sneaking or smoking weed in countries where you can be killed for weed.</p>

			<p>The Trump administration opposes nationwide hemp production, California takes action against unlicensed marijuana businesses, and Massachusetts fears a medical cannabis shortage.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a closer look at some notable developments in the marijuana industry over the past week.</p>
<p><strong>Hemp sector fires back</strong></p>
<p>The hemp industry gasped this week when a Trump administration official said hemp production <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/worried-hemp-overproduction-trump-administration-cautions-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">should remain limited</a> and that drug enforcers, not agriculture officials, should retain oversight of the crop.</p>
<p>Greg Ibach, undersecretary for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said there shouldn&#8217;t be nationwide hemp production and warned that oversupply could &#8220;kill the market for hemp.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ibach&#8217;s comments alarmed some hemp growers and activists, most of whom want to see hemp rules loosened in the next Farm Bill, which is being rewritten this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cannabisbenchmarks.com/annual-review-and-outlook-2017-2018-edition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-66014" src="https://mjbizdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/cannabis-benchmarks-ad.jpg" alt="" width="300"></a>&#8220;To build the market, we need the government to get out of the way,&#8221; said Jason Amatucci, executive director of the Virginia Industrial Hemp Coalition.</p>
<p>Hemp growers were even more alarmed by Ibach&#8217;s comment that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, not the Agriculture Department, should oversee hemp.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the USDA has a very large role in the regulation of hemp production,&#8221; Ibach said. &#8220;It&#8217;s more at (the Department of) Justice and DEA.&#8221;</p>
<p>That was anathema to hemp producers and activists.</p>
<p>&#8220;This should be treated as an agricultural commodity,&#8221; said Jonathan Miller, lawyer for the U.S. Hemp Roundtable, a lobbying group that pushes for hemp expansion.</p>
<p><strong>California enforcement</strong></p>
<p>As part of a renewed effort in California&#8217;s decades-long battle with its cannabis black market, the state&#8217;s Bureau of Cannabis Control sent out <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/california-initiates-enforcement-unlicensed-marijuana-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cease-and-desist letters to roughly 500 companies</a>.</p>
<p>Now that a fully legal industry has been rolled out, there&#8217;s likely to be more pressure than ever on illicit companies that are trying to avoid obtaining business permits, paying taxes and generally playing by the rules.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;ll be slow going, said Los Angeles attorney David Welch, who has been trying to shut down unlicensed operators for over a year on behalf of permitted dispensaries in Southern California.</p>
<p>&#8220;The problem (authorities) run into is resources. They aren&#8217;t actually able to effectuate the closure of hundreds of illegal stores operating in the state,&#8221; Welch said about the prospect of state and local authorities shuttering all unlicensed businesses.</p>
<p>Los Angeles has even dedicated a 30-person task force to cracking down on illegal MJ companies.</p>
<p>But that won&#8217;t be enough, Welch predicted.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are hundreds of illegal stores,&#8221; he said. &#8220;If you look at 30 people &#8230; you&#8217;re still looking at 12 hours (per law enforcement raid), not to mention the man hours going into each one of these raids. So that&#8217;s the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another consideration is that a lot of dispensaries are still trying to rely on the old medical cannabis collective model, which will likely just extend the life of the black market.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re 12 people in (a town) and you&#8217;re growing marijuana and sharing amongst each other, you&#8217;re a collective,&#8221; Welch explained. &#8220;If you are 12 people and one person is selling marijuana at a counter, you&#8217;re a commercial dispensary, a 10-type license.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it working? No. Is it legal in my opinion? No.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it gives people the excuse to sink money into operating illegal dispensaries.&#8221;</p>
<p>One avenue Welch wants to pursue is what he calls &#8220;private enforcement actions&#8221; &#8211; filing suit against illegal dispensaries on behalf of legal ones.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a technique his firm&#160;<a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2017/01/27/legal-vs-illegal-pot-shops-lawsuit-alleges-one-can-put-the-other-out-of-business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has used successfully</a>&#160;in Santa Ana.</p>
<p>&#8220;We closed down seven of the illegal stores,&#8221; Welch said, &#8220;and we&#8217;re trying to effectuate judgments against 14.</p>
<p>&#8220;So we&#8217;ve done it before, and we&#8217;re looking to do it again in the city of L.A., which is truly the biggest problem.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Don&#8217;t overreact, Massachusetts</strong></p>
<p>Concerns about whether Massachusetts will have enough marijuana supply when the state&#8217;s recreational market launches are legitimate, but they shouldn&#8217;t be cause for overreaction, according to one industry analyst.</p>
<p>The Bay State is slated to begin adult-use sales in July, and some are worried there <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/massachusetts-fears-medical-marijuana-shortage-adult-use-sales-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">won&#8217;t be enough cannabis</a>, medical or otherwise, to go around.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the first couple of months after legalization, supply constraints could well be an issue,&#8221; said Kris Krane,&#160;managing partner of Boston-based 4Front Ventures.</p>
<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;ll be a short-term concern.&#8221;</p>
<p>He pointed out that the industry has seen similar situations in other states that have gone recreational, including Colorado, Washington and Oregon.</p>
<p>Using Oregon as an example, Krane cautioned that Massachusetts regulators shouldn&#8217;t try to correct the market through licensing more growers.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason Oregon is <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/decimated-oversupply-oregons-wholesale-marijuana-prices-drop-50-pound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having the oversupply issues</a> that they&#8217;re experiencing is because in the early days of the adult-use program they were having supply-constraint issues,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>According to Krane, Oregon&#8217;s problems were twofold:</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumers complained that prices were too high, so some still bought from the black market.</li>
<li>Retailers opened, then ran out of supply and closed until they got restocked.</li>
</ul>
<p>Oregon&#8217;s regulators then issued more licenses &#8211; an overreaction, Krane says &#8211; and now there&#8217;s too much product.</p>
<p>&#8220;The issue wasn&#8217;t necessarily that there weren&#8217;t enough licenses,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It was that the licensees hadn&#8217;t scaled up yet. It takes time.&#8221;</p>
<p>Krane believes Massachusetts has enough canopy space currently under construction to eventually meet demand.</p>
<p>&#8220;I caution against people overreacting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This happens in every market.&#8221;</p>

INSERT INTO articles VALUES (12511, 'Women and Men Consume Cannabis In Nearly Equal Numbers: And Other Stats That Will Blow Your Mind', NULL, 'wertsdfg.jpg', '<div class="post-content entry-content cf">
											    	<p>As legalization spreads throughout the nation, the cannabis industry is gaining credibility in multiple sectors, including education, testing and consumer data. I recently spoke with Linda Gilbert, Managing Director of Consumer Insights for <a href="http://www.bdsanalytics.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">BDS Analytics</a>, a Colorado-based company specializing in cannabusiness-driven data, who emphasized that, despite the stereotypes, &#8220;There is no one cannabis consumer.&#8221; There are cannabis users from all walks of life; they just don&#8217;t talk about their use in the same way as, say, a twenty-year-old college student does.</p>
<p>BDS Analytics has data for days&#8212;prepare to have your mind blown by these stats. As someone in the industry, even I was shocked by what Linda was telling me. But hey, numbers don&#8217;t lie.</p>
<p>The following figures are based on information gathered from adults 21 and over in California, Washington, Oregon and <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/colorado-cannabis-starbucks/" data-wpel-link="internal">Colorado</a> last year. BDS Analytics groups participants into three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Consumers: </strong>Someone who has &#8220;consumed cannabis within the past six months.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Acceptors: </strong>Someone who has &#8220;<em>not</em> consumed cannabis within the past six months, but would consider [doing so] in the future.&#8221;</li>
<li><strong>Rejecters: </strong>Someone who has &#8220;not consumed cannabis within the past six months and would not consider [doing so] in the future.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<h4><img class="aligncenter wp-image-34469 size-full" src="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Participant-Category-Breakdown1.jpg" alt="BDS Analytics Cannabis Statistics" width="1200" height="1004" srcset="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Participant-Category-Breakdown1.jpg 1200w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Participant-Category-Breakdown1-768x643.jpg 768w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Participant-Category-Breakdown1-1024x857.jpg 1024w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Participant-Category-Breakdown1-770x644.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></h4>
<h4>Participant category breakdown:</h4>
<p><strong>Consumers &#8211; 28%</strong></p>
<p><strong>Acceptors &#8211; 34%</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rejecters &#8211; 38%</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Rejecters make up the largest percentage here, but I think it&#8217;s more significant to look at the Consumer and Acceptor groups. Together, that means that 62% of participants either partake in cannabis, or <em>would </em>partake in cannabis. That&#8217;s huge!</p>
<p>And we all know the &#8220;lazy stoner&#8221; stereotype&#8212;that we&#8217;re unemployed (or underemployed), unambitious, you name it. But as Linda declared, &#8220;People who use cannabis make more money!&#8221; See for yourself:</p>
<h4><img class="aligncenter wp-image-34470 size-full" src="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Average-Household-Income.jpg" alt="BDS Analytics Cannabis Statistics" width="1564" height="1160" srcset="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Average-Household-Income.jpg 1564w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Average-Household-Income-768x570.jpg 768w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Average-Household-Income-1024x759.jpg 1024w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Average-Household-Income-770x571.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1564px) 100vw, 1564px"></h4>
<h4>Average annual household income</h4>
<p><strong>Consumers &#8211; $72.5.1k</strong></p>
<p><strong>Acceptors &#8211; $69.1k</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rejecters &#8211; $69.6k</strong></p>
<p>Linda also shocked me with some gender breakdowns. I&#8217;ve covered <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/diane-czarkowski-canna-advisors/" data-wpel-link="internal">women in cannabis</a> frequently here at DOPE, and have had the pleasure to interview scores of successful women who love weed, but I still figured smoker stats would skew wildly male. Men consume more cannabis than women, yes, but not by as wide of a margin as I anticipated:</p>
<h4><img class="aligncenter wp-image-34471 size-full" src="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Gender-Breakdown.jpg" alt="BDS Analytics Cannabis Statistics" width="1489" height="1329" srcset="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Gender-Breakdown.jpg 1489w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Gender-Breakdown-768x685.jpg 768w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Gender-Breakdown-1024x914.jpg 1024w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Gender-Breakdown-770x687.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1489px) 100vw, 1489px"></h4>
<h4>Gender Breakdown</h4>
<p>Consumers &#8211; 56% male | 44% female</p>
<p>Acceptors &#8211; 44% male | 56% female</p>
<p>Rejecters &#8211; 39% male | 61% female</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/end420shame-college-high/" data-wpel-link="internal">&#8220;young stoner&#8221; stereotype</a> has also proved false. Linda noted that the average age for smokers in the four states is 42&#8212;hardly the twentysomething toker clich&#233;.</p>
<p>In their age breakdowns, the highest percentage of Consumers fell in the age 25-34 category with 30%; Acceptors in the 65+ category with 22%; and Rejecters in the 65+ 29%. The Consumer stats aren&#8217;t surprising, but it&#8217;s remarkable that the age group most interested in trying cannabis happens to be 65+.</p>
<h4>Other insights include:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Millennials are more likely to use cannabis for anxiety and to feel happy (social purposes) while <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/boomers-knock-knock-knocking-cannabis/" data-wpel-link="internal">Baby Boomers</a> tend to use cannabis for pain relief.</li>
<li>70% of cannabis users prefer inhalable consumption (bongs, vapes, etc.) but 24% prefer edibles, 4% prefer topicals and 1% prefer &#8220;other.&#8221;</li>
<li>Those who have never used cannabis before or haven&#8217;t used cannabis in some time are more likely to consume <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/chocolate-coda-signature-edibles/" data-wpel-link="internal">edibles</a> than any other consumption method.</li>
<li>Linda predicts that as more Baby Boomers age and cannabis becomes less stigmatized, edibles will have their heyday, as they&#8217;re discrete, precise and provide the option to microdose. Keep an eye out for more innovation in this arena targeted at newbies and older folks, specifically with CBD products.</li>
<li>Regardless of age, cannabis is most often used in the evening before bed. 35% of participants report consuming before bed, while 28% consume in the morning (with the rest of participants reporting afternoon usage or multiple sessions throughout the day).</li>
<li>People who consume cannabis are more likely to describe themselves as socially conscious; compared to other industries, cannabis consumers are more interested in how things are grown/processed and <em>will</em> pay more for a better, safer product that&#8217;s eco-friendly, local&#8212;the so-called &#8220;cannasseurs.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>Mind blown? Me, too. And I write and edit cannabis stories for a living! These stats are proof that, as Linda affirmed, there truly isn&#8217;t one single cannabis user. We aren&#8217;t lazy, we aren&#8217;t mostly men, and we are successful members of society. Put that in your pipe and smoke it!</p>

<p>A woman arrested after advertising illicit <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">weed</a> business on Snapchat reminds us that very few things are private anymore.</p>
<p>In the age of social media, anybody can be, for lack of better terms, <em>anything</em>. A pseudo-celebrity, a faux-model, or even an unspecified &#8216;entrepreneur&#8217;.</p>
<p>Apparently, it has even facilitated the transition to becoming a bottom of the barrel weed dealer.</p>
<p>Or at least, this was the case of an inept drug dealer who blatantly advertised her own illicit weed business on the social media app<a href="https://hightimes.com/culture/snapchat-under-fire-for-420-filter-celebrating-bob-marley-with-digital-blackface/"> Snapchat</a>.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>Questionable Marketing</h2>
<p>According to <a href="http://beatricedailysun.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/snapchat-post-lands-woman-in-jail/article_2ae1876a-b37c-50e1-8eab-72d67aa08d85.html" rel="nofollow">The Beatrice Daily Sun</a>, Nebraska authorities were tipped off about a video on Madison Carlson&#8217;s Snapchat that depicted a large bag of cannabis, with a corresponding caption reading &#8220;Hit me up.&#8221;</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t take a veteran criminal detective to decipher the young woman&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>Following the post, authorities went to Carlson&#8217;s residence around 9:30 PM and immediately noticed two cars in a nearby alley with their lights on.</p>
<p>In one vehicle, police found Carson and one female minor. According to police documents, the car wreaked of weed. In the other, a male juvenile, who, upon further inspection, was carrying a concealed bag of marijuana in his waistband.</p>
<p>The two female accomplices told police they had just gotten rid of the pot until Carlson was removed from the vehicle, and eventually forked over an additional 32 grams and $80 in cash.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>The women then admitted to selling weed to the male juvenile and splitting the profits. Police also found unnamed paraphernalia&#160;within the confines of Carlson&#8217;s home, after allowing the authorities to do so.</p>
<p>Per the Sun, Carlson was then arrested, and charged for&#160;the distribution of a controlled substance to a juvenile, use of a juvenile to distribute a controlled substance, possession of marijuana with intent to distribute.</p>
<p>She was also charged with possession of drug money, two counts contributing to the delinquency of a minor, possession of more than an ounce of marijuana and possession of drug paraphernalia.</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;Woman Arrested After Advertising Illicit Weed Business On Snapchat</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what sort of charges the minors face, considering their juvenile status, but Carlson could be in over her head.</p>
<p>Nebraska remains underdeveloped, in terms of cannabis laws, and all forms of marijuana remain illegal in the state.</p>
<p>Although the plant was partially decriminalized back in 1979, the state <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/oklahoma-and-nebraska-are-still-trying-to-shut-down-the-colorado-cannabis-industry/">hasn&#8217;t had much success in further implementing the plant in mainstream society</a>.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>Back in 2015, the &#8220;Cannabis Compassion and Care Act,&#8221;was proposed in front of state legislators, but the bill was ultimately nixed in 2016.</p>
<p>The legislation would have allowed for medical patients with serious illnesses such as&#160;such as cancer,&#160;glaucoma, and HIV, to utilize medicinal cannabis in liquid or pill form.</p>
<p>However, the state could go forward with another proposed legislation,&#160;Lincoln Sen. Anna Wishart<a href="https://hightimes.com/news/will-nebraska-residents-able-vote-medical-marijuana/"> has proposed a constitutional amendment resolution</a>, which would allow Nebraska residents to vote on legal medical marijuana.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Carlson, however, there are no provisions being drawn up for recreational Snapchat dispensaries.</p>

(<em>AP</em>) &#8212; The number of people licensed to use medical marijuana in New Mexico has grown substantially since the state began the program a decade ago.</p>
<p>The latest figures from the state Health Department show a total of 48,821 patients were enrolled at the end of February. Almost half of them list post-traumatic stress disorder as a qualifying condition.</p>
<p>Patients must meet at least one of 21 conditions for a medical marijuana card. The other most common qualifying conditions include severe chronic pain and cancer.</p>
<p>State health officials have been careful over the years to expand the list of conditions. Still pending is a petition to allow medical marijuana to be used as a tool in the fight against opioid abuse and the associated withdrawal symptoms.</p>

											    	<h4>Who Is Affected?</h4>
<p>After rolling back Obama-era federal protections on some of the nation&#8217;s most pristine National Parks and Monuments in late 2017, the Trump Administration has continued to auction off swaths of the West in an attempt to attract new lease sales for fossil fuel drilling, fracking and mining. Although it&#8217;s true there are several oil-rich areas that will offer up substantial energy benefits and resources on government-leased territory, there are still many regions and states affected by these new policies that don&#8217;t see an upside for residents.</p>
<p>Take, for instance, the microsystems that supply beauty and life to the high deserts of eastern Nevada. According to Nevada hydrologist Tom Myers, Ph.D., the effects of drilling and fracking in the proposed lease areas in eastern Nevada containing sensitive groundwater basins &#8220;threatens the hydrogeology of the area, including regional springs and intermittent and perennial streams. The potential impacts include both contamination and depletion of flow.&#8221; Meyers published his findings in a report entitled &#8220;Review of Hydrogeologic Aspects of the December 2017 Oil and Gas Lease Sale, Ely District Office<u>.&#8221;</u></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-34723 size-full" src="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sdfertwrt.jpg" alt="" width="1625" height="833" srcset="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sdfertwrt.jpg 1625w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sdfertwrt-768x394.jpg 768w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sdfertwrt-770x395.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1625px) 100vw, 1625px"></p>
<p>With such critical ecosystems at risk, the implications of what could happen to the entire region&#8217;s fauna, flora and groundwater are seemingly obvious. However, in <em>Trumpland</em> there has been no apparent environmental concern whatsoever. Gas, gold and oil have taken precedence over food, health and water.</p>
<h4>Which states are impacted?</h4>
<p><strong>&#160;</strong>We&#8217;ve seen federal downsizing of historic proportions in Utah, expanses of California and Nevada auctioned off, and plans for offshore oil drilling along the entire Pacific Coastline&#8212;and that&#8217;s just the beginning. As reported by Keith Schneider of the <em>L.A. Times</em>, &#8220;The Interior Department reported that auctions of federal drilling leases earned $316.2 million in revenue in 2017, about 61% higher than the $196.7 million that the government made from leasing in 2016.&#8221;</p>
<h4>What types of eco-disasters are we facing?</h4>
<p><strong>&#160;</strong>The complications from groundwater contamination and depletion could be devastating to the region&#8217;s agriculture, fish and wildlife, ranching, recreation and, most importantly, its drinking supply, leaving behind a wide range of carcinogenic complications for future generations to come. And though some of the richest oil reserves lie just off the Pacific shoreline, are <em>Trumponomics</em> worth another disaster like BP&#8217;s Deepwater Horizon spill in 2010? Unfortunately, those who have made attempts to thwart federal lease auctions have been met with <a href="http://www.coloradoindependent.com/164880/how-blm-lease-sales-work-can-i-bid-on-blm-lease-sales" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">jail time or have been personally targeted by the government. </a></p>
<p>However, that doesn&#8217;t mean we stop the fight to protect our Earth. We must become the watchdogs of the government and those buying land leases to ensure the land remains protected, and take drastic measures to protect our environment&#8212;and our future. We must put pressure on politicians and corporations to divest from fossil fuels, endorse businesses with sustainable practices, strive every day to reduce our carbon footprint, and, most importantly, we must speak out. We only have one planet. Don&#8217;t let it become <em>Planet</em> <em>Trump.</em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although the USPS publicly claims they are intent on stopping Americans from using the mail service to transport cannabis, the evidence suggests they have not been very successful. According to a recent Freedom of Information Act request by Denver ABC News affiliate </span><a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/investigations/record-number-of-mailed-marijuana-packages-caught-by-feds-in-colorado-last-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Channel 7</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, the number of seized packages containing marijuana that were discovered in Colorado has risen every year since 2012, including 934 packages in 2017, up from 805 the prior year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After 2013, the United States Postal Inspection Service reported two consecutive years of decreased marijuana seizures in 2014-15, a dip some </span><a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2016-03-14/drug-mail-drops-after-pot-stores-open" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">attributed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to the new legal recreational markets taking hold and beginning to choke out the black market&#8217;s output. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The statistics indicated a decrease in the number of pounds seized, which isn&#8217;t necessarily a reflection of the actual volume of cannabis being channeled through the USPS. The declining number of pounds seized could also represent fewer resources being spent on chasing marijuana cases than an actual decrease in the number of packages being shipped overall. The exact reason for the decline is unclear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2015, researchers from Carnegie Mellon released a </span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-soska-updated.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> detailing the scope of currently active darknet drug marketplaces, which primarily use the USPS to facilitate shipping. The study estimated the average daily revenue of the most prominent marketplaces fluctuated between $300,000 to $500,000 each, with cannabis accounting for roughly a quarter of all darknet sales. A seperate 2015 </span><a href="https://qz.com/466273/what-illegal-drugs-cost-on-the-dark-web/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> found the median price of darknet marijuana to be $215.31 an ounce.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-soska-updated.pdf"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-82350 size-full" src="https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/darknetdrugs.png" alt="darknet-distribution-graph" width="664" height="643" srcset="https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/darknetdrugs.png 664w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/darknetdrugs-300x291.png 300w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/darknetdrugs-300x291@2x.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px"></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Using the reported darknet-wide averages as a basis to find out how many pounds of cannabis get shipped from darknet vendors to private end users, the highest traffic darknet markets were shipping between 21.8 and 36.3 pounds of marijuana every day. Using these averages, the most frequented darknet destinations send between roughly 8,000 and 13,000 pounds of marijuana annually &#8212; each.</span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-soska-updated.pdf"><br>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Experienced shippers use the Postal Service because they know it is run by the United States government, unlike privately held competitors like FedEx and UPS. As a government-operated entity, the USPS is bound by our Constitution, which protects citizens and their packages from unwarranted search and seizure. Before USPS can inspect your package, the department must obtain a warrant. They may, however, hold your package until they have a warrant.</span><a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity15/sec15-paper-soska-updated.pdf"><br>

<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">First-Class letters and parcels are protected against search and seizure under the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution, and, as such, cannot be opened without a search warrant.

Other classes of mail do not contain private correspondence, and therefore may be opened without a warrant.</span></p></blockquote>

The person&#8217;s name and references to specific geographic locations have been removed to protect his identity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Marijuana.com</strong>: Can you give us any sort of idea scale-wise of the marijuana problem the USPS faces?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>John Doe</strong>: I personally know a couple of hundred people that were basically doing the same thing I was. I was responsible for over $1 million in pot being bought and shipped, because to me it was worth a few million. But I was a small fish. Where I was shipping 20 pounds per week, some of these people were sending 150 pounds every week. Everybody out there was shipping back east. It&#8217;s crazy, hundreds of millions of dollars are going through the USPS. I know one person who was buying $10 million per year in pot and shipping it up and down the east coast, so you can only imagine what he was making.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>MJ</strong>: The percentage of packages they seize is so small compared to what must be going through.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JD</strong>: Oh, definitely. I only had around 20 packages popped and I did it every week for five years straight. I got away with the vast majority of my shipments. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>MJ</strong>: Why do people prefer to send marijuana through USPS rather than FedEx or UPS?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JD</strong>: The reason everybody ships through USPS is that it&#8217;s run by the government, so there&#8217;s an extra level of rules and regulations they have to follow. For example, the USPS needs to get a search warrant before they can open your package, whereas if a private shipping company wants to use dogs to sniff out packages of weed, they have that right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>MJ</strong>: What would happen when you had a package flagged?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JD</strong>: You&#8217;d know if your package was flagged and officially reported to authorities because the screen with the tracking information would turn all red and say &#8220;seized by US Government&#8221; or something similar. If a USPS employee snagged your box and didn&#8217;t report it up the chain of command, it would just say &#8220;out for delivery&#8221; on the tracking screen for eternity. As the sender, who am I going to report that to? Nobody, it&#8217;s just the cost of doing business.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>MJ</strong>: Did you ever have a USPS employee helping you out on either end of the shipment?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JD</strong>: Yes, we had someone on the inside on the east coast. We knew him from way back because we smoked with him in high school. He got a job at the USPS around the time we moved out west, so it was really easy. We just gave him a percentage every week to make sure our packages got to where they were supposed to. He never knew what was in the packages, just to let them go through. While it was risky for him, he was making an extra $1,000 every week from us.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The temptation for postal employees to snag a suspicious package here or there (or let one through) is not lost on USPS brass. The organization offers a reward of up to $50,000 to any employee who turns over information or evidence leading to a conviction of &#8220;mailing or causing to be mailed any controlled substances, illegal drugs, or the proceeds from the sale of illegal drugs.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reports of suspicious package theft by postal employees reportedly became so rampant that the USPS conducted an </span><a href="https://www.uspsoig.gov/sites/default/files/document-library-files/2016/HR-AR-17-001_Redacted.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">internal audit</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to identify and contain the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their conclusions read like a child&#8217;s unfinished Mad Lib, with rampant redactions concealing potentially revealing findings.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the report doesn&#8217;t flat-out say that employees were caught putting marijuana-filled packages in their private stash rather than reporting them up the chain, the flurry of redactions and the agency&#8217;s actions post-audit at least raise significant suspicion. Following the audit, the </span><a href="https://www.uspsoig.gov/document/packages-suspected-containing-marijuana" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">USPS announced</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> plans to implement &#8220;a nationwide policy for handling, tracking and providing additional security for packages suspected of containing marijuana to reduce the risk of these packages being lost or stolen.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you&#8217;re wondering how deep in the cannabis mailing game a USPS employee would have to be to turn their nose at a $50,000 reward, look no further than this branch manager from Washington, D.C. who was accused of having received and flipped more than 220 pounds of marijuana.</span></p>

He would then instruct Brantley and Norman to meet individuals, who would offer cash in exchange for the packages, on the street during their routes.

<p>As California&#8217;s legal adult-use pot laws go into effect, Native American tribes are seeking equity in legal cannabis. More than 100 federally recognized Indian tribes call the state home. Now some of them want into the lucrative <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a> market created by voters when they passed Prop 64 in 2016.</p>
<h2>Native American Sovereignty</h2>
<p>Under state regulations, all cannabis products sold in the state must be produced by licensed growers and manufacturers. The new rules require license&#160;holders to submit to strict regulations and pay steep taxes. Only the state can issue those licenses.</p>
<p>Tribal lawyer Mark Levitan <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/tribes-cut-california-pot-market-grow-53348620" rel="nofollow">told a national news outlet</a> that this is an affront to <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/legalization/native-american-tribes-converge-to-discuss-marijuana-legalization/">Native American sovereignty</a>. &#8220;They have to give up their rights to act as governments, with regard to cannabis,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Instead, tribes would have to agree to &#8220;submission&#160;of all enforcement&#8221; under state rules. They would also be forced to include a waiver of &#8220;sovereign immunity&#8221; in applications for licenses.</p>
<p>Tribes and the state attempted to come to an agreement before the new rules went into effect on January 1. When they were not able to make a deal, a trade group warned the state that tribes may take things into their own hands.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>In December, the California&#160;Native American Cannabis Association sent a letter to state regulators. In it, they warned the government that the tribes&#160;&#8220;may engage in commercial cannabis activities through our own inherent sovereign authority.&#8221;</p>
<p>If that happens,&#160;&#8220;the state will have no jurisdiction to enforce its cannabis laws and regulations on tribal lands,&#8221; the letter said.</p>
<p>But that would mean tribes would have to restrict their cannabis growing and sales to their own lands. Their products would not be able to enter the state&#8217;s licensed market.</p>
<h2>Is There a Solution in Sight?</h2>
<p>In an effort to avoid that scenario, tribes are now seeking to create compacts between the state and Native American tribal governments. These agreements would allow tribes access to the legal market for their goods. Also, the state would affirm that tribes would retain &#8220;exclusive authority&#8221; for the regulation of cannabis operations on their lands.</p>
<p>Such an agreement would be similar to one that was struck between tribes and the State of Washington. Since pot was legalized in that state, seven tribes have come to terms with the government. Even more are still in talks to do so.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>In California, lawmakers are working on a similar pact.&#160;&#8220;Everyone agrees conceptually there should be an even playing field, a level playing field,&#8221; said&#160; Rob Bonta, a Democratic state assemblymember from Oakland. But hammering out an agreement will take time. It may take until the end of 2018 for them to reach a deal.</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;Native American Tribes Are Seeking Equity in Legal Cannabis</h2>
<p>Of course relations with the federal government are another matter entirely. Previously, prosecutors were instructed not to act against people and firms complying with state cannabis laws.</p>
<p>Those protections extended to tribal lands. But when Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole memo earlier this year, all operators, including Native American ones, are again at risk.</p>
<p>In the end, it all comes down to fairness.&#160;Paul Chavez, a former chairman of the Bishop Paiute tribe, said that California&#8217;s Native Americans &#8220;just want to be able to do business in the state of California and elsewhere, just like anybody else.&#8221;</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://thetimes-tribune.com/news/police-man-offered-scranton-officer-money-pot-to-avoid-dui-1.2305964" rel="nofollow">The Times-Tribune</a>, 35-year-old&#160;Matthew Byron tried to get out of a DUI charge on Christmas night by offering a Scranton officer weed.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the policeman didn&#8217;t go for the unofficial plea deal.</p>
<p>Byron now faces felony charges of bribery, and misdemeanor counts of driving under the influence, possession of a small amount of <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a> and possession of drug paraphernalia. A preliminary hearing was originally set for Thursday, before being rescheduled to March 29th.</p>
<p>Police were initially&#160;called for a disturbance, where they found Byron asleep at the wheel of his SUV, with the front wheels of the vehicle&#160;hanging over a cement barrier. The police knocked on the driver side window to wake up the snoozing driver and ordered Byron to open the door.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>When he complied with the officer&#8217;s request, the vehicle&#160;exhumed a strong odor of alcohol&#160;and Byron stumbled out of the car, and at one point, almost falling over in a drunken stupor.He also proclaimed he knew one of the arresting officers, Patrolman&#160;Kyle Gilmartin, from high school. The officer vehemently disagreed.</p>
<p>Byron, who police believed was far too inebriated to adequately perform a <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/cops-to-get-potalyzers-for-roadside-marijuana-tests/">roadside sobriety test</a>, was ordered to sit in the back seat of the patrol car, where they would proceed to take him to booking. It was there that the intoxicated Byron began bargaining for his freedom.</p>
<p>Gilmartin warned the man to stop bribing him, but Byron continued to press the issue.</p>
<p>&#8220;Come on, bro,&#8221; Byron said to Gilmartin.&#160; &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you money or get you weed and we can smoke together, whatever you want, just let me go.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">

		</div>

<p>Following the arrest, police officers also found a small bag of marijuana in the arrestee&#8217;s car. He was held on $5,000 bail, before being bonded out.</p>
<h2>Final Hit: Man Tries To Bribe Police Officer With Weed</h2>
<p>Clearly, Matthew Byron wasn&#8217;t in the correct mindstate to adequately process the implications of his actions. Had Byron not &#8216;bribed&#8217; his arresting officer, he would&#8217;ve still been in hot water, considering his impairment, but he wouldn&#8217;t have had an additional felony charge on his rap sheet, either.</p>
<p>Either way, Byron learned a valuable lesson in the ordeal&#8212; do not <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/radical-rant-the-war-between-booze-and-weed/">drink and drive</a>.</p>

<p>The legalization of <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> sets off a number of far-reaching ripple effects. It touches everything from public health to local economies to law enforcement policies, and much more. The ripple effects of legal weed also impact violent crime. Here&#8217;s what happens to violent crime when marijuana is legalized.</p>
<h2>Violent Crime and Legal Weed</h2>
<p>The short answer to the question, what happens to violent crime when marijuana is <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/5-states-most-likely-to-legalize-cannabis-next/">legalized</a>, is simple: it decreases. That decrease happens largely because legal weed <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/prohibition-end-cartel-violence/">disrupts the black market</a>. At the same time, legalization places cannabis into the legal economy. That makes it much easier to track and regulate.</p>
<p>Of course, there&#160;are tons of other concerns that weed&#8217;s move into the legal economy raises. For example, it&#8217;s important that a handful of massive corporations doesn&#8217;t immediately monopolize the newly legal weed market. Such a development could potentially turn legal weed into the next Big Pharma.</p>
<p>Similarly, it&#8217;s crucial that we keep the legal weed economy from repeating the racial inequities that define the War on Drugs. It&#8217;s counterproductive if the legal weed industry ends up profiting only wealthy white business owners while millions of people of color continue dealing with the injustices of prohibition.</p>
<p>With all that said, it does appear that legalization helps decrease violent crime. In fact, this is exactly what a&#160;<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ecoj.12521/full" rel="nofollow">study</a> published in November 2017 found. In this study, researchers reviewed FBI crime reports and homicide records. They looked at records from 1994 through 2012.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Researchers found that legal marijuana coincided with noticeable drops in violent crime. These changes were most pronounced in states bordering Mexico.</p>
<p>In these states, violent crime dropped by an average of 13 percent when cannabis was legalized&#8212;even if it was only medical marijuana.&#160;More specifically, border states saw a 41 percent decrease in the number of homicides directly linked to drugs. Similarly, robbery decreased by 19 percent and murder rates fell by 10 percent.</p>
<h2>Shooting Down the Myths</h2>
<p>Studies like this help counter many of the stereotypes and negative myths that continue to swirl around the topic of legalization. In particular, these stats help shoot down the myth that legal weed will lead to more crime and more violence.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the fact-checking website <a href="https://www.snopes.com/marijuana-legalization-violent-crime/" rel="nofollow">Snopes.com </a>has already classified this myth as false.&#160;&#8220;Although this claim appears to be making its way into political talking points regarding <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/state-next-vote-recreational-marijuana/">recreational marijuana</a>,&#8221; the site states, &#8220;no credible evidence has been provided to support it.&#8221;</p>
<p>And Snopes is right. Under <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/jeff-sessions-justification-marijuana-crackdown-bogus/">Attorney General Jeff Sessions</a>, the myth that legal weed leads to more crime is getting new life. One of the first things Sessions did after being appointed AG was start <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/jeff-sessions-anti-pot-federal-crackdown-full-force/">going after cannabis</a>. And one of his main speaking points is the idea that legalization spurs more violent crime.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">

		</div>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think America is going to be a better place when people of all ages, and particularly young people, are smoking pot,&#8221; Sessions <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jeff-sessions-marijuana-comments_us_58b4b189e4b0780bac2c9fd8" rel="nofollow">said</a> in early 2017. &#8220;I believe it&#8217;s an unhealthy practice, and current levels of <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/science/thc-tetrahydrocannabinol/">THC</a> in marijuana are very high compared to what they were a few years ago, and we&#8217;re seeing real violence around that.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Sessions, data doesn&#8217;t back up the claim that weed produces more violence. In fact, studies like the one published last November suggest the exact opposite.</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;Here&#8217;s What Happens To Violent Crime When Marijuana Is Legalized</h2>
<p>So, what happens to violent crime when marijuana is legalized? From what we can tell so far, it looks like legal weed helps reduce violent crime.</p>
<p>Legalization breaks up the black market. It decreases the need to <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/trumps-wall-promises-big-profits-for-smugglers/">smuggle</a> drugs across borders. And it significantly cuts down on the likelihood that violence will erupt when people try to buy or sell weed.</p>
<p>For example, just last month <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/dj-khaleds-fiancees-brother-killed-weed-deal-gone-bad/">DJ Khaled&#8217;s future brother in law</a> was shot and killed during a weed deal gone bad. If he could have just gone to a dispensary and purchased weed legally, the entire outcome would probably be different.</p>

<p>In fact, the photo is over a year old and the restaurant welcomes all guests &#8220;without judgement, an IHOP spokesperson tells The Cannabist.</p>
<p>In the photo, a typo-laden sign read:</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;IHOP will not serve/seat guest with strong marijuana odor. Thank you, Managment&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>The photo was posted on Facebook by Matthew Porter III on March 6. It proceeded to go viral with over 13,000 shares, and was picked up by a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/trees/comments/81bap2/ihop_near_my_house_just_put_up_this_sign_the/">massive Reddit feed.</a>&#160;The photo has since been deleted from Reddit.</p>

<p>The sign was actually posted by one franchised restaurant in St. Louis over a year ago, IHOP spokesperson Stephanie Peterson said via email. The IHOP at 10910 New Halls Ferry Road, St. Louis, removed the sign almost immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure at the time someone at the restaurant had good intentions and was likely trying to honor a guest request,&#8221; she said. &#8220;This is not system-wide or a policy and is outdated signage. The brand and our franchisees are all about welcoming guests in without judgement.&#8221;</p>

<p>The driver, who police say may have been experiencing a medical condition, ran a red light before striking the pedestrians, according to NBC New York. Since 2016, the driver&#8217;s car has been issued four summonses for red light camera violations, and four more for school zone speeding violations, according to public records viewed by Staten Island Live.</p>
<p>The incident underscores a troubling trend in road safety in recent years: After decades of decline in the rate of fatal car accidents, numbers have crept back up in recent years. The trend is particularly pronounced for pedestrian fatalities: In 2016, the most recent year with complete Transportation Department data, nearly 6,000 pedestrians were struck and killed by vehicles on public roads.</p>
<p>That number is up by an alarming 46 percent since it hit a record low of 4,109 pedestrian fatalities in 2009. In raw number terms, 2016 had the highest number of pedestrian crash fatalities since 1990. Adjusted for population, in 2016 the rate of pedestrian fatalities per 100,000 people was the highest since 1998.</p>

<p>Experts suspect the increase is driven by a number of factors. Last month, the Governors Highway Safety Association released a report noting that rising pedestrian fatalities are correlated with the growth in smartphone adoption and use. Although deaths related to distracted driving are, on the whole, trending downward, smartphone use could be affecting pedestrians, too, by making them less aware of their surroundings.</p>
<p>Substance use is another factor. The GHSA specifically calls out marijuana use, noting that in the first half of 2017, pedestrian fatalities increased greatest in <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2016/10/14/legal-marijuana-laws-by-state-map-united-states/62772/">states that had previously voted to legalize recreational marijuana</a>. Like smartphones, marijuana can impair both drivers and pedestrians.</p>
<p>But looking at state-level data for all of 2016, there isn&#8217;t any clear correlation between marijuana legality and pedestrian deaths. States in the southern half of the country generally have higher rates of pedestrian fatalities than more northern states.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Related:&#160;<a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/02/09/colorado-marijuana-users-drive-high/98653/">Colorado is asking marijuana users why they drive high</a></strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Alcohol is another known factor in pedestrian fatalities. Eighteen percent of drivers involved in fatal pedestrian crashes tested positive for alcohol, compared with 38 percent of pedestrians involved in these crashes, according to a report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. When a driver strikes and kills a pedestrian, in other words, the pedestrian is more likely to have consumed alcohol beforehand than the driver.</p>
<p>Other metrics of pedestrian risk, including one developed by Smart Growth America, an advocacy group for walkable cities, show a similar state-level pattern. Smart Growth America&#8217;s index of pedestrian danger is correlated with both income and rates of health insurance: Metro areas that are poorer or have more uninsured people tend to see more pedestrian fatalities.</p>
<p>Less-affluent cities may have less money to spend on safe, walkable street design, which appears to be a factor in pedestrian deaths.</p>
<p>One final factor is vehicle speed. Faster driving is correlated with both higher rates of pedestrian accidents and a decreased chance of survival for pedestrians who get struck. For these reasons, New York City lowered its default speed limit from 30 to 25 mph in 2014. That program appears to be bearing fruit: In 2017, the number of pedestrians killed in traffic accidents in New York City fell to its lowest level since 1910.</p>

<p>Shortly after Sessions&#8217; speech to law enforcement officials, the Democratic governor accused the attorney general of lying and trying to appease President Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Sessions said several California state laws prevent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers from making deportation arrests and singled out elected officials for their actions. He had particularly strong words for Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf, who issued an unusual public warning last month about an immigration operation.</p>
<p>&#8220;How dare you?&#8221; he said of Schaaf at a California Peace Officers Association meeting in Sacramento. &#8220;How dare you needlessly endanger the lives of law enforcement just to promote your radical open borders agenda?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Justice Department, in a federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in Sacramento, is challenging three California laws that bar police from asking people about their citizenship status or participating in federal immigration enforcement activities.</p>
<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t something I chose to do, but I can&#8217;t sit by idly while the lawful authority of federal officers are being blocked by legislative acts and politicians,&#8221; Sessions said, straying from his prepared remarks.</p>
<p>More than a dozen attendees in a room of about 200 people gave the attorney general a standing ovation.</p>
<p>The lawsuit is the latest salvo in an escalating feud between the Trump administration and California, which has resisted the president on issues from taxes to marijuana policy and defiantly refuses to help federal agents detain and deport immigrants. </p>
<p>U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has said it will increase its presence in California, and Sessions wants to cut off funding to jurisdictions that won&#8217;t cooperate.</p>
<p>&#8220;I say: Bring it on,&#8221; said California Senate President Pro Tem Kevin de Leon, a Los Angeles Democrat who wrote the so-called sanctuary state bill. Democratic Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon was among those suggesting that Sessions shouldn&#8217;t come at all.</p>

<hr>
<p>The lawsuit was filed as the Justice Department also reviews Schaaf&#8217;s decision to warn of an immigration sweep in advance, which<br>
ICE said allowed hundreds of immigrants to elude detention. Schaaf said Tuesday that the city would &#8220;continue to inform all residents about their constitutional rights.&#8221;</p>
<p>The California laws were passed in response to Trump&#8217;s promises to sharply ramp up the deportation of people living in the U.S. illegally.</p>
<p>One prohibits employers from letting immigration agents enter worksites or view employee files without a subpoena or warrant, an effort to prevent workplace raids. Another stops local governments from contracting with for-profit companies and ICE to hold immigrants. Justice Department officials said that violates the Constitution&#8217;s supremacy clause, which renders invalid state laws that conflict with federal ones.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court reinforced the federal government&#8217;s primacy in enforcing immigration law when it blocked much of Arizona&#8217;s tough 2010 immigration law on similar grounds. The high court found several key provisions undermined federal immigration law, though it upheld a provision requiring officers, while enforcing other laws, to question the immigration status of people suspected of being in the country illegally.</p>
<p>In this case, California &#8220;has chosen to purposefully contradict the will and responsibility of Congress to protect our homeland,&#8221; Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said in a statement.</p>
<p>Sessions, who has blamed sanctuary city policies for crime and gang violence, spoke Wednesday to groups representing police chiefs, sheriffs, district attorneys, narcotics investigators and the California Highway Patrol. Only the California State Sheriffs&#8217; Association actively opposed the so-called sanctuary law.</p>

<p>Dozens of demonstrators chanted &#8220;stand up, fight back&#8221; and &#8220;no justice, no peace&#8221; outside the hotel where the meeting was held and some blocked traffic on a major thoroughfare. A heavy police presence was on hand.</p>
<p>Demonstrator Henry Gordon of Sacramento said he hopes Sessions gets the message that Californians will resist efforts to separate families and deport immigrants.</p>
<p>Becerra, who is up for election in November, said sanctuary policies increase public safety by promoting trust between immigrant communities and law enforcement, while allowing police resources to be used to fight other crimes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re in the business of public safety, not deportation,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The proposal adds six new pages of Fairbanks General Code dealing with marijuana establishments and licensing, and is up for second reading, public comment and a likely vote at Monday&#8217;s council meeting, the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported.</p>

<p>Fairbanks currently has five operating licensed retail stores. Four licenses have been considered by the council and are waiting on a certificate of occupancy before opening. One licensee is appealing a decision by the Alcohol and Marijuana Control Office.</p>
<p>The limit of 12 retail stores was not chosen for any particular reason, Fairbanks Mayor Jim Matherly said.</p>
<p>It is unclear what will happen to the remaining applicants that haven&#8217;t reached local government if the council approves the 12-store limit. Fairbanks City Clerk Danyielle Sinder&#8217;s interpretation, based on ordinance language, is that no more will be allowed.</p>
<p>&#8220;The council hasn&#8217;t really addressed that yet,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I think the council has some work left to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Alaska statute limits the number of alcohol licenses based on population, but Fairbanks has many times the allowable number because of grandfather rights.</p>

<p>Did Donald Trump really call for the execution of drug dealers? Five sources close to President Trump say that he often jokes and makes comments about killing drug traffickers. According to the political news website Axios, Trump has been telling friends about his desire to kill drug dealers for months.</p>
<p>Sources report that the President&#8217;s comments should be taken seriously, that they aren&#8217;t simply jokes. Rather, insiders say Trump believes a death penalty for drug dealers is the only way to effectively reduce drug-related deaths.</p>
<h2>Did Donald Trump Really Call For The Execution Of Drug Dealers?</h2>
<p>President Trump seems to have taken inspiration for his plan to execute dealers from countries where drug trafficking, even of <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a>, carries a mandatory death sentence.</p>
<p>A senior official in the Trump administration <a href="https://www.axios.com/newsletters/axios-sneak-peek-301a7e4c-56bc-482e-950b-ec3752d46049.html" rel="nofollow">told Axios</a> that Trump &#8220;often jokes about killing drug dealers&#8230; He&#8217;ll say, &#8216;You know the Chinese and Filipinos don&#8217;t have a drug problem. They just kill them&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>If true, Trump&#8217;s comments would echo those he made during a visit to the Philippines last November to meet with Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte. At the meeting, Trump <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/philippines-duterte-calls-for-genocide-against-drug-users/">praised the extrajudicial killings</a> of thousands of alleged drug dealers and drug users in the Philippines. He said Duterte was doing &#8220;an unbelievable job on the drug problem&#8221; there.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Others accuse President <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/martial-law-declared-in-south-philippines-trump-praises-dutertes-drug-war/">Duterte of committing crimes against humanity</a> by overseeing the executions of upwards of 8,000 people suspected of involvement with illegal drugs. Earlier this month, the International Criminal Court opened a preliminary investigation into those accusations.</p>
<p><a href="https://hightimes.com/news/the-man-singapore-executed-for-marijuana/">Singapore</a> also has a mandatory death penalty for drug trafficking offenses. Sources close to President Trump say he believes the harsh penalties for drug dealers are the reason Singapore has low drug consumption rates.</p>
<p>Axios reports that a source who has spoken about the issue with Trump says &#8220;He says that a lot. He says, &#8216;when I ask the prime minister of Singapore do they have a drug problem, [the prime minister replies,] &#8216;No. Death penalty&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Trump reportedly makes frequent comparisons between drug dealers and serial killers. He suggested he wanted drug dealers in America to fear for their lives.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>Will Trump Put His Plan Into Action?</h2>
<p>So did Donald Trump really call for the execution of drug dealers? It seems that way. Although Trump has reportedly acknowledged the virtual impossibility of passing a law to execute drug dealers in America. Though he says he would love to if he could. Other White House officials say the President&#8217;s remarks are more nuanced than they appear.</p>
<p>Former Trump campaign manager and current Counselor to the President Kellyanne Conway told Axios the President is referring to high-volume drug dealers when he talks about executing dealers in America. Conway currently serves as head of the White House&#8217;s anti-drug efforts.</p>
<p>According to Conway, Trump&#8217;s point is that since homicide can carry a death sentence, drug dealers who distribute multiple lethal doses of drugs should face the same penalty.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s likely the President is referring to the <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/oregon-police-stop-drug-field-tests-fentanyl-exposure/">synthetic opioid fentanyl</a>. According to the National Institute for Drug Abuse, fentanyl caused <a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates" rel="nofollow">nearly a third</a> of 2016&#8217;s 64,000 drug-overdose deaths.</p>
<p>In October of last year, Trump <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/trump-to-declare-opioid-crisis-a-national-emergency/">declared</a> the nation&#8217;s lethal opioid epidemic a public health emergency. But critics of the move argued it did not direct any substantial federal funds at combating the epidemic.</p>
<p>Currently, federal law requires a five-year mandatory minimum sentence only if a person is convicted of dealing forty grams of fentanyl or more. Yet just two milligrams of the opioid <a href="https://www.dea.gov/druginfo/fentanyl-faq.shtml" rel="nofollow">can be lethal</a>.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentC -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc article_middleContentC dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>As a result, Trump is extremely likely to back legislation that places <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/jeff-sessions-blames-marijuana-opioid-crisis/">harsher penalties on drug traffickers</a>. According to Axios, the President, along with some advisors, are discussing further &#8220;zero-tolerance&#8221; drug policies, especially those that would target young people.</p>

<p>This spring, conventions for <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a>, tattoos and alternative models will converge into one venue in an event called The Cons. The event,&#160;which is the first of its kind, will take place in Miami, Florida. And this event is already garnering excitement and anticipation from all three industries.</p>
<h2>The Cons</h2>
<p>The Cons was co-founded by Stacey Havoc and Clinton Cox. They saw the previous success of conventions dedicated to the alternative model and tattoo industries. And they knew, instinctually, that the growing cannabis sector would fit in seamlessly.</p>
<p>&#8220;After four great years in Miami with Cam Con,&#8221; Cox said in a press release, &#8220;it seemed like a natural fit for today&#8217;s world, as Inked Culture, Cannabis Culture and Alternative Model Culture are overlapping.&#8221;</p>
<p>In addition to being dedicated to cannabis, alternative models and tattoos, The Cons will cater to people working in these industries as well as fans who want to expand their education about their interests.</p>
<p>&#8220;This market is starving for information,&#8221; Cox added. He says that The Cons will feature sessions aimed towards those who wish to stake their claim in these markets. Because these industries, particularly the cannabis industry, is seeing a rapid growth, events like The Cons could prove invaluable to industry hopefuls.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>Havoc explains, &#8220;we are excited to show the cannabis industry how to produce a proper Miami Beach poolside B2B and B2C show.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;The Cons, The First Multi-Alternative Lifestyle Expo, Coming To Miami</h2>
<p>The cannabis business has been quickly evolving from illicit deals to a <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/billion-global-cannabis-market-foreseen/">multi-billion dollar industry</a>. Thus, events like these are extremely valuable for anyone who is interested in joining the Green Rush. With the huge influx of medical research, scientific studies and spreading legalization, the cannabis space has the potential to be one of the most important industries. Not only in the United States but the world.</p>
<p>The Cons will be at&#160;SLS Miami Beach, starting on May 29 and ending on June 1, 2018. For more details and registration information, visit their website <a href="http://thecons.biz/" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

<p>As the opioid crisis continues to ravage the United States, more and more people are looking to <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> as a solution. In Connecticut, new proposals mean this state may add opioid withdrawal to medical marijuana program. The state Board of Physicians is considering this week whether to allow the use of cannabis for opiate withdrawal. The board could add four more serious medical conditions to list, as well.</p>
<h2>Medical Cannabis in Connecticut</h2>
<p>Currently, the state maintains two lists of health issues eligible for treatment with medical cannabis. Adult patients suffering from 22 conditions can make use of medical marijuana therapies. The list for patients under 18 includes six diseases.</p>
<p>Cancer, seizure disorders, <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/science/marijuana-help-hiv-patients-maintain-mental-stamina/">HIV/AIDS</a>&#160;and others are currently allowed under the program. Nearly 24,000 patients have qualified for the program, according to state records. More than 800 doctors have gained state approval to prescribe medical cannabis to patients.</p>
<p>The abuse of <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/raining-needles-opioid-crisis-creates-major-syringe-threat/">opioids has become the worst drug epidemic</a> in the country&#8217;s&#160;history. The Centers for Disease Control announced that more 64,000 people died from an accidental overdose in 2016. Overdose is now the most common cause of death for those under the age of 50.</p>
<p>As more and more Americans succumb&#160;to the scourge of opioid addiction, people are looking to medical marijuana as a possible answer to the problem. Besides reducing symptoms of withdrawal, the use of medical marijuana to treat pain can reduce the need for opiates in the first place.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">

<p>A <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1898878" rel="nofollow">study</a> published in&#160;<em>JAMA&#160;</em>in 2014 revealed that states with medical marijuana programs had 25 percent fewer opioid deaths than states that didn&#8217;t.</p>
<h2>Other Conditions Under Consideration</h2>
<p>In addition to treating those suffering withdrawal from opioid addiction, the Board of Physicians is also considering four more conditions. Patients with albinism could be allowed to use cannabis to treat the genetic condition&#8217;s impact on eye health.</p>
<p>Patients with another eye condition, nystagmus, could also benefit from medical marijuana to calm uncontrollable eye movements associated with the disease.</p>
<p>A genetic disease known&#160;as osteogenesis imperfecta that causes bones to break easily could also be added to the state&#8217;s list. Progressive degenerative disc disease of the spine&#160;is under consideration for addition, as well. The condition causes severe neck or back pain.</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;This State May Add Opioid Withdrawal to Medical Marijuana Program</h2>
<p>As the use of medical marijuana continues to gain acceptance, opiates could be beginning to lose favor at the same time. Last year, the FDA asked the maker of Opana ER to remove the drug from the US market. Opana ER is a brand name for the opioid painkiller oxymorphone.</p>
<p>The FDA decided the risks from the drug outweighed its benefits. It was the first time the FDA had removed an opioid from sale because of its risk of abuse. In the<a href="https://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm562401.htm" rel="nofollow"> announcement</a> of the action, FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottleib hinted that it might not be the last.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>That&#8217;s the takeaway from an economic study cultivation tech company <a href="http://weedindex.io/#fullstudy">Seedo published following the&#160;2018 Cannabis Price Index detailing the cost of marijuana.</a> It looks at&#160;marijuana use, legality, cost, and calculates the potential taxes in 120 cities across the world.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/11/14/new-york-marijuana-legalization-panel/92309/">New York City&#160;</a>consumes the most cannabis in the world, ingesting/smoking a whopping 77.44 metric tons annually. While population is obviously the biggest factor, the city&#8217;s cannabis consumption is three times that that of American runner-up Los Angeles, which consumed 36.06 metric tons.</p>
<p>Denver barely cracked the top 10 for U.S. cities, consuming 6.2 metric tons, according to the study.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
<p>The amount of marijuana consumed wasn&#8217;t the only factor Seedo looked at. Price per gram in each of the cities was also examined.</p>
<p>No surprises here: The <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/09/05/marijuana-weed-prices-national/87342/">legal marijuana states had the most affordable marijuana per gram</a>. Seattle was lowest at $7.58 per gram, Denver next at $7.79 and Los Angeles comes in third at $8.14.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/09/28/washington-dc-marijuana-gift-legal/88893/">Partially-legal city Washington D.C.</a> had, by far, the most expensive price per gram in the country at $18.08.</p>

(Graphic provided by Seedo)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Internationally, where weed remains illegal, prices soar. The most expensive marijuana per gram is found in Tokyo, Japan, at $32.66 USD per gram. Jet down to Quito, Ecuador, for the cheapest marijuana on the list, costing just $1.34 USD on average.</p>
<p>Using the current average tax rates on legal marijuana in America, Seedo researchers calculated how much big cities might rake in if it was legalized, taxed and regulated. New York City topped the list at $156.4 million in hypothetical taxes.</p>

<hr>
<p>If the current tax rate on cigarettes in American were to be applied to legal marijuana, that number more than doubles. In New York City, for instance, would haul in over $354.4 million annually.</p>
<p>Seedo, a tech firm behind an DIY cultivation device, does have a fiduciary interest in cannbis and the company doesn&#8217;t sugarcoat their mission: &#8220;The aim of this study is to illustrate the continuous need for legislative reform on cannabis use around the world, and to determine if there are any lessons to be learned from those cities at the forefront of marijuana legalisation.&#8221;</p>

<p>The first bill, introduced by the &#8220;Lefties&#8221; proposed considering small amounts of up to 15 grams no longer a criminal offense. Currently, possession of even small amounts of cannabis results in the opening of a penal case, but most cases are suspended a few weeks later due to a &#8220;lack of public interest.&#8221;</p>
<p>The second bill, introduced by the FDP (Liberals), requested to create a legal basis for cannabis pilot projects in Germany, so individual federal states such as Berlin, Bremen, or cities like D&#252;sseldorf and M&#252;nster, can implement corresponding plans. So far, the Federal Ministry of Health has rejected such applications in principle because, according to the Ministry, there is no legal basis for doing so.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Greens have presented a 69-page draft bill on cannabis regulation to the Bundestag. This document grabbed headlines as the <a href="https://hanfverband.de/nachrichten/presseecho/germans-mark-a-milestone-in-the-fight-to-legalize-marijuana">cannabis control law</a> three years ago and was one milestone to spark the persisting discussion in German parliament and society alike.</p>
<h2><b>Uncertainty factor SPD</b></h2>
<p>During the debate, the CDU (Conservatives) criticized the legalization plans of the opposition parties, while the right-wing populist AFD frequently mentioned crystal meth, which was not part of the bill&#8217;s wording. Most of the SPD (Social Democrat)-MPs sent out positive signals, even though the opinion towards legalization in the second largest parliamentary group in the Bundestag was met with skepticism.</p>
<p>In purely mathematical terms, for the first time&#160;a majority of members of parliament in the German Bundestag (the three smaller parties plus parts of the Social democrats) favors the liberalization of cannabis laws. But so far, none of the three proposals have been voted upon. Instead, they have been forwarded to committees for further consideration in order to submit them once again to Parliament when the coming government is elected to office by the Bundestag.</p>
<p>Enacting new laws has been impossible for months, because almost half a year after the last general election, Germany still has no viable government. As it currently stands, the government will again be formed of a CDU/SPD coalition and all three bills will be blocked, even if one-third of the SPD may already be convinced of the advantages of a regulated cannabis market.</p>
<p>But in Germany, the parliamentary group&#8217;s arrangements usually have a higher priority than an MP&#8217;s personal opinion. Just like <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Angst">&#8220;German Angst,&#8221;</a> it is hard to translate &#8220;Fraktionszwang,&#8221; the word used for it. Party discipline would come quite close. In most cases, the MPs of one party will discuss the issue internally and decide in advance on a common parliamentary veto.</p>
<p>If the SPD-MPs have to stick to this unwritten rule when it comes to the votes on the three bills, there will be neither model projects nor a cannabis control law. Their big partner, Merkel party CDU, did not discuss the topic during the past coalition negotiations and presumably never will in the coming four years. Cannabis simply is not a topic in the recently negotiated coalition contract, regulating governing policy for the next four years in details.</p>
<p>Only in exceptional cases will the governing coalition parties forgo the force to vote unanimously, mostly when it comes to moral issues. For example during the last parliamentary term, on the vote on equal marriage, parliamentarians were exempted from arrangements or their party&#8217;s opinion, but guided by their conscience. But it is unlikely that the two future governing parties will consider cannabis laws as a moral issue and drop the &#8220;Fraktionszwang&#8221;.</p>
<p>If the SPD basis does not speak out clearly for a change in cannabis legislation soon and set the MPs under pressure by doing so, nothing will change in next four years.</p>
<p>After having voted in the legalization of medical cannabis in 2017, the country&#8217;s oldest party does not seem to be ready yet for recreational cannabis bills, even though the intra-party discussion on cannabis is gaining momentum.</p>

<p>Current law prohibits people from consuming marijuana in public places, including sidewalks and hotels. The bill Republican Representatives Scott Beck and Janssen Willhoit introduced Thursday would give local governments more authority to regulate consumption on private property as well.</p>
<p>Republican Gov. Phil Scott&#8217;s marijuana commission is supporting the bill. Still, Democratic Rep. Cindy Weed says lawmakers may be &#8220;jumping the gun.&#8221;</p>
<p>The House Committee on Government Operations will vote on the bill Friday. If approved, it would go into affect July 2, 2018.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This puts cannabis in the same company as more conventionally well-known doping narcotics like opioids, ephedrine and anabolic steroids. However, this has not stopped KYND Cannabis Company sponsoring professional cyclist Teal Stetson-Lee in Nevada, helped by the state legalising recreational marijuana consumption in 2016. It&#8217;s a strange position for an athlete to find themselves in, but points to the fact that a broader trend towards decriminalising marijuana could see the world of dope and the world of cycling develop an unlikely relationship.</span></p>
<p><b>A Gray Area</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2009 former </span><a href="http://vuelta.club/"><span style="font-weight: 400">w</span></a><a href="http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/missy-giove-from-world-champion-to-convict-and-back-again/"><span style="font-weight: 400">orld champion mountain biker Melissa Giove</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> was busted for possession of roughly 350 pounds of cannabis. Indeed, federally cannabis is still classified as an illegal narcotic. Indeed, cannabis is a schedule one narcotic, which places it in the same category as &#8220;hard drugs.&#8221; However, cannabis has an ever more vocal chorus of patients and scientists preaching the innumerable medicinal qualities of this plant. The scientific community has been taking more serious investigations into the benefits of certain types of cannabis molecules to treat various mental and physical ailments, and as the possibilities of health benefits become grounded in more legitimate research, it&#8217;s no wonder mainstream media publications are also slowly destigmatising their coverage of cannabis use. Of course, there&#8217;s </span><a href="http://vuelta.club/"><span style="font-weight: 400">a</span></a> <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4417655/"><span style="font-weight: 400">wide variety of different kinds of cannabis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> with varying degrees of effectiveness, with treatment also being contingent on the size of the dose, type of cannabinoid used and method of application. What possible benefits could this bear on cyclists?</span></p>
<p><b><img class=" wp-image-69905 alignleft" src="https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bike-242x350.jpg" alt="" width="413" height="597" srcset="https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bike-242x350.jpg 242w, https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bike.jpg 496w, https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bike-242x350@2x.jpg 484w" sizes="(max-width: 413px) 100vw, 413px">The Survey Says&#8230;</b></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.medicaljane.com/2014/06/13/chronic-pain-and-the-theraputic-benefits-of-medical-cannabis/"><span style="font-weight: 400">Marijuana&#8217;s ability to treat chronic pain</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> is one of the better-researched aspects of potential medical applications. This could certainly benefit cyclists looking to pass further through the pain barrier for extended periods of cycling. Certain types of cannabinoid receptors, principally CB1 and CB2, which when triggered can result in an increase in somatic cardiovascular capacity through a process known as angiogenesis. The ability to send more blood to vital organs boast an obvious appeal to cycling enthusiasts. CB2 receptors can also regulate nitrous oxide generation, which helps cells activate in low-oxygen conditions. This can benefit any athlete, but the boost to high altitude mountain bikers is particularly interesting. It&#8217;s not all good news, though: THC has been found to increase a person&#8217;s resting heart rate and diminish the heart&#8217;s productivity during periods of extended exertion. It&#8217;s also found to increase blood pressure with short-term use. Although long-term use can see a drop over time, it also leads to a greater risk of hypotension. </span></p>
<p><strong>The Verdict</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ultimately, the consensus on whether cannabis use could benefit physical activities like cycling hasn&#8217;t been reached. There still needs to be much more high-level research on the issue. Thankfully, with changing attitudes, that looks to be more of a likelihood in the future. Even then, the decision will come down to personal preference. The same dose and strain of marijuana can have very different effects on two different people, and tolerance and the background of a person&#8217;s general mental health also has a big impact on the results of cannabis consumption. It&#8217;s too early to say, in other words, but it looks to be a fascinating research topic for some time to come.</span></p>

If you&#8217;re prone to being disorganized, then this might hit very close to home. There are those aberrations of people who seem to have everything filled and locked down, they&#8217;re never late, never lost, and their socks always match. This monastic level of organization probably doesn&#8217;t come naturally to too many of us, and there&#8217;s something comforting in a little chaos.</p><p>There&#8217;s some things, however, that you want to keep as tidy and organized as possible, your love life, your wallet, and your smoking kit. There&#8217;s nothing worse than sitting down to roll and finding that you misplaced your papers, your grinder, or, perish the thought, your herb.</p><p>The average smoking kit has a whole host of components that are worryingly easy to misplace or lose. For one thing you have your papers, your grinder (which is often multi-part), a packing tool, roaches, maybe a pipe, and of course your herb. If you just have that stuff lying around loose it&#8217;s far too easy to lose it. The last thing you need when you want to relax with a joint is the stress of finding you lost a vital part of your smoking kit.</p><p>If you want to avoid this stress, then there&#8217;s a few steps you can take to help yourself become a bit more organised. Nothing too transformative, there&#8217;s no need to transform yourself into a sterile human-filofax. It&#8217;s just a few tips that will save you a little stress.</p><h3><a href="https://the420times.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smoking_kit_interior.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-43245" src="https://the420times.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smoking_kit_interior-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" srcset="http://3s0ugl1qamwo3v5dm83nwpw0.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smoking_kit_interior-300x200.jpg 300w, http://3s0ugl1qamwo3v5dm83nwpw0.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smoking_kit_interior-768x513.jpg 768w, http://3s0ugl1qamwo3v5dm83nwpw0.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smoking_kit_interior-360x240.jpg 360w, http://3s0ugl1qamwo3v5dm83nwpw0.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smoking_kit_interior-600x400.jpg 600w, http://3s0ugl1qamwo3v5dm83nwpw0.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smoking_kit_interior.jpg 878w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"></a></h3><h3>Get A Case for Your Smoking Kit</h3><p>The best way to keep your smoking kit together is to keep it in a dedicated carrying case. If you only smoke in the privacy of your own home, then the case is ideal as it saves you from rummaging around your room for that pack of paper that you swear you left just there this morning. If you&#8217;re out and about then a good case will stop any loose bits from your kit from going rogue on your travels.</p><p><a href="https://www.everyonedoesit.com/products/the-very-happy-kit?utm_source=the420times&amp;utm_medium=sponsored-adv&amp;utm_campaign=happykit-run1">The Very Happy Kit</a> is an ideal example of a bespoke smoking kit. It&#8217;s everything you could need, it has a solid, discrete exterior, a whole range of handy pockets, straps, and pouches.</p><p>The Very Happy Kit really comes in handy when you want to carry it when you&#8217;re out and about. Its case is fully smell proof, so if you value discreteness, or if you prefer to keep your clothes free from the aroma of your herb then this is invaluable. While we all love the smell of our weed, we don&#8217;t need that potent odor sticking to our clothes or hair.</p><p>On top of all this <a href="https://www.everyonedoesit.com/collections/happy-kit?utm_source=the420times&amp;utm_medium=sponsored-adv&amp;utm_campaign=happykit-run1">the Happy Kit</a> is perfect for first time smokers; it comes bundled with everything you need to put together a great smoking kit. When you first open it up you&#8217;ll find some papers, roaches, a carrying tube for a pre-rolled joint, a plastic grinder with sifter screen, and even a full glass pipe! If you&#8217;re a more experienced smoker, then simply swap out The Very Happy Kit&#8217;s contents for your own materials of choice.</p><h3>Cut Down On Your Kits Individual Components</h3><p>Simply put, the more you have in your kit, the more you have to lose. It&#8217;s easy to stuff your kit to the gills with everything you think you might need for a good smoke, but this can just lead to a bulky kit and more opportunities to misplace something you really need. If you want a kit that won&#8217;t let you down, then you need to trim some of the fat.</p><p>The big questions are the easiest to answer, what do you prefer? Hand-rolled joints or a well-packed pipe? This is what you&#8217;ll be building your kit around, so it&#8217;s an important question! The next thing you need to do is get rid of anything you don&#8217;t use often; do you really need three different sizes of rolling paper? Do you really need filters and a roach book? Finally, try to get multi use items, get a combination pack of skins and roaches, or a grinder/storage jar combo.</p><h3>Get Rid of The Rubbish</h3><p>Once you get your kit up and running it&#8217;s easy to think your job is done but keeping your kit in peak condition is an ongoing task. Over time you&#8217;ll find that empty boxes of skins will build up, along with used up roach books, and of course grime and ash can build up too. Clearing out anything that&#8217;s used up is a must if you want to make sure that your kit will serve you well, the last thing you want is to open up your case to find nothing but empty wrappers and ash in side it.</p><p>So from time to time make sure that your skins are topped up, the ash is wiped out, and your pipe is clean and its airpath free and easy to use!</p><h3><a href="https://the420times.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smoking_kit_outdoor.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-43246" src="https://the420times.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smoking_kit_outdoor.jpg" alt="" width="599" height="400" srcset="http://3s0ugl1qamwo3v5dm83nwpw0.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smoking_kit_outdoor.jpg 878w, http://3s0ugl1qamwo3v5dm83nwpw0.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smoking_kit_outdoor-300x200.jpg 300w, http://3s0ugl1qamwo3v5dm83nwpw0.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smoking_kit_outdoor-768x513.jpg 768w, http://3s0ugl1qamwo3v5dm83nwpw0.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smoking_kit_outdoor-360x240.jpg 360w, http://3s0ugl1qamwo3v5dm83nwpw0.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smoking_kit_outdoor-600x400.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 599px) 100vw, 599px"></a></h3><h3>Make Sure Your Kit Is Fit For Purpose</h3><p>It&#8217;s tempting to grab any old container or bag that looks big enough to fit your smoking kit. I&#8217;ve seen old iPhone boxes, tupperware, and even old headphone bags used to keep a smoking kit together. These all work fine, until they don&#8217;t. They&#8217;re not intended to be any kind of portable case, never mind for your smoking kit. Sooner or later, they&#8217;ll go to pieces and spill your smoking kit&#8217;s contents out!</p><p>If you&#8217;re going to build a smoking kit then go the extra mile and get a bespoke case. <a href="https://www.everyonedoesit.com/products/the-very-happy-kit?utm_source=the420times&amp;utm_medium=sponsored-adv&amp;utm_campaign=happykit-run1">The Very Happy Kit</a> is an ideal example, it was built from the ground up to be a smoking kit and has taken the dat-to-day trials of the life of a smoking kit into account.

<p>Thanks&#160;to a decision this week by the West Virginia board that regulates medicinal <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> in the state, this state could allow smokable forms of medical marijuana, <a href="https://www.wvgazettemail.com/news/health/wv-s-medical-marijuana-board-recommends-smokable-forms-of-marijuana/article_b18c33d2-964f-5594-8551-7b1b66f2255f.html" rel="nofollow">according to reports in local media</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/west-virginia-medical-marijuana-program-board-set-to-meet/">West Virginia</a> legislature legalized medical marijuana in 2017 and established the Medical Cannabis Advisory Board to recommend policy. The&#160;Department of Health and Human Resources (DHHR) Bureau for Public Health oversees implementation of the law and the state&#8217;s medical cannabis program.</p>
<p>The advisory board met Tuesday at the University of Charleston and heard recommendations from three different subgroups. The subgroups have been working to address concerns from the medical cannabis community about the new law.</p>
<p>The law bans smoking medical marijuana, a provision criticised by cannabis advocates. One of the subgroups was charged with determining whether flower, leaf and other dry plant forms of marijuana should be allowed.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>The subgroup, chaired by Dr. Michelle Easton, decided that these cured plant types of cannabis should be permitted for use in vaporizers. The board agreed, but left in place the prohibition against smoking.</p>
<h2>But Who&#8217;s to Know?</h2>
<p>Dr. Rahul Gupta, the commissioner for DHHR&#8217;s bureau for public health and state health officer, acknowledged that once someone has these forms of cannabis, it&#8217;s really up to them what happens next.</p>
<p>&#8220;People can combust [it] themselves if they want, but that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re advocating or recommending,&#8221; said Dr. Gupta.</p>
<p>That group also recommended rescheduling cannabis in the state from Schedule 1 to Schedule 4. The board postponed approval of that recommendation until it can obtain more information on the legal ramifications of the proposal.</p>
<p>A second subgroup reviewed the supply chain authorized by the state&#8217;s medical marijuana law and its effect on patients ability to affordably access their&#160;medicine.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Current regulations permit only 10 cultivators, 10 processors, and 30 dispensaries. The subgroup recommended an increase or elimination of those caps.</p>
<p>West Virginia&#8217;s medical marijuana law limits patients who can participate in the program to those suffering from a specific list of serious medical conditions, including <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/study-25-percent-cancer-patients-use-medical-marijuana/">cancer</a>, HIV/AIDS, <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/girl-first-medical-marijuana-patient-texas/">epilepsy</a>, chronic pain and others. The third working group reviewed that list and make recommendations on new additions.</p>
<p>Dr. Jim Felsen, the leader of that subgroup, said that they had decided not to add any more conditions at this time.</p>
<p>He noted that he had received many requests to include anxiety &#8220;but just throwing anxiety on their qualifies 80 percent of the population to get cannabis and I don&#8217;t think&#8212;reading the statute&#8212;that&#8217;s what the Legislature had in mind.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Final Hit: This State Could Allow Smokable Forms of Medical Marijuana</h2>
<p>Jim Kennison is a Vietnam <a href="https://hightimes.com/grow/best-strains-veterans/">veteran</a> who suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and ALS. He expressed his gratitude and contrition to the board.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have time and I want to apologize for a couple of shout-outs. That was me. It was because sometimes I get a little tired with playing around with the semantics &#8230; when I was coming up here I was thinking man, I could use a little oil because my anxiety level is through the roof.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

		</div>

<p>Legislative staff will be clarifying the entire set of recommendations from Tuesday&#8217;s advisory board meeting within days. They will then be presented to the legislature, which is now in session.</p>
<p>West Virginia&#8217;s medical cannabis law goes into effect in 2019, with the first patients expected to receive identification cards in July of that year.</p>

			<p>A bill to regulate the production of medical marijuana in Malta would make the country among the first in the European Union to lay the groundwork for cannabis manufacturing and position it as a supplier in the 28-nation bloc, according to executives and analysts.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://parlament.mt/media/92408/bill-24-production-of-cannabis-for-medicinal-use-bill.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Production of Cannabis for Medicinal Use Act</a>, which would apply to dried cannabis, cannabis oil, seeds and derivatives, passed its <a href="https://parlament.mt/en/13th-leg/bills/bill-no-024-production-of-cannabis-for-medicinal-use-bill/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second reading</a> Feb. 20 and is in committee review.</p>
<p>The bill would not allow&#160;smokable medical marijuana in Malta.</p>
<p>A final vote is expected in March, Parliamentary Secretariat for Consumer Protection Deo Debattista told <em>Marijuana Business Daily</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://mjbizconference.com/next/?utm_source=daily%20website&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=Early%20Bird%20NEXT%202018&amp;_ga=2.116676806.1530335314.1519056354-932032620.1493223513" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-66014" src="https://mjbizdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/NEXT2018-3-square.jpg" alt="" width="300"></a>&#8220;Accessibility to quality medicinal cannabis shall safeguard patients who will no longer need to opt for cannabis purchased from uncontrolled sources, with all the concerns that illicit forms of cannabis may entail,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Under the bill, a business wanting to produce medical cannabis would have to obtain a letter of intent from the country&#8217;s economic development agency, Malta Enterprise, which would constitute preliminary approval.</p>
<p>After that, the Medicines Authority would issue a license for the premises.</p>
<p>Three medical cannabis companies<strong>&#160;</strong>have already signed letters of intent, and discussions with three more companies are at an advanced stage, according to Deepak Anand, vice president of government relations for the Vancouver, British Columbia-based consultancy Cannabis Compliance.</p>
<p>The Medicines Authority would regulate the industry.</p>
<p>Another notable change under the bill: All doctors accredited by the Maltese Medical Council could prescribe medical cannabis; only some government-approved doctors can do so currently.</p>
<p>All products would have to comply with EU Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), an internationally recognized quality standard.</p>
<p>&#8220;There will be job creation, and if the industry does take off, it would place Malta among the forerunners in Europe in terms of manufacturing and exporting and (would) assumedly be very profitable,&#8221; said Johnathan Cilia, co-founder of the Valletta-based group <a href="http://releaf.com.mt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReLeaf</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Malta&#8217;s potential export market</strong></p>
<p>Being a member of the European Union gives Malta natural advantages when it comes to doing business within the trading bloc.</p>
<p>&#8220;The market for medical cannabis is increasing exponentially worldwide,&#8221; Julia Farrugia Portelli, a member of parliament who also serves as Parliamentary Secretary for Reforms, Citizenship and Simplification of Administrative Processes, told <em>Marijuana Business Daily</em>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a niche market that Malta can exploit for a number of reasons.&#8221;</p>
<p>These advantages include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strict manufacturing standards for pharmaceuticals.</li>
<li>Membership in the world&#8217;s second-largest trading bloc.</li>
<li>Experience in high-security, highly regulated sectors.</li>
<li>A robust history between government agencies and corporations.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;Our model acts as a pull factor aimed at attracting global players, foreign investment, generating employment and widening the portfolio of our pharmaceutical industry,&#8221;&#160;said Portelli.</p>
<p>Portelli was one of the parliamentarians charged with overseeing medical cannabis legalization on behalf of the Office of the Prime Minister.</p>
<p>Malta will be the latest domino to fall in Europe, Anand predicted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Malta, being an EU member state and indeed one of the first to set up detailed cannabis manufacturing facilities, is naturally positioned to be one of the most suitable cannabis suppliers to other member states as well as the rest of the world,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The European medical cannabis market is the largest in the world, worth an estimated 35.7 billion euros per year,&#160;according to a recent European Medicines Agency report.</p>
<p>A number of other countries are laying the groundwork to export medical cannabis into the EU, including&#160;<a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/israel-hits-pause-medical-marijuana-exports-cronos-exec-not-concerned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Israel</a>, <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/canadas-tilray-build-marijuana-production-arm-portugal-serve-eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Portugal</a> and <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/aurora-cannabis-inks-deal-build-europes-largest-cannabis-facility-denmark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Denmark</a>, but&#160; none have facilities up and running.</p>
<p><strong>Canada sees an opening</strong></p>
<p>Anand said Maltese GMP manufacturers would be clear partners for Canadian companies looking to expand their footprint overseas.</p>
<p>&#8220;As new and additional medical cannabis markets open up around the world,&#8221; he said, &#8220;the demand for GMP product formulations which aren&#8217;t smoked or vaped will be significant.</p>
<p>&#8220;And this is where companies who have partnered with, manufactured and QP-released medical cannabis products under EU-GMP from Malta, will have a huge advantage.&#8221;</p>
<p>One of Canada&#8217;s largest international cannabis companies is already laying the groundwork to enter the market.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nuuvera signed a letter of intent with its partners some time ago to form a joint venture to seize the opportunity emerging from the new legislation,&#8221; said Antonio Costanzo, head of international development with Nuuvera.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will communicate more details in the coming days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Last month, Aphria agreed to acquire Nuuvera, a global cannabis company headquartered in Toronto, in a <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/aphria-buys-nuuvera-ca820m-create-dominant-international-marijuana-company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stock-and-cash deal</a> valued at 826 million Canadian dollars ($669 million).</p>
<p>The&#160;<a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/italy-addresses-systematic-medical-marijuana-shortage-canadian-imports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">week before</a>, Nuuvera became one of only seven companies in Italy with a license to import medical cannabis.</p>
<p>&#8220;The legislation currently in parliament has the characteristics to position Malta as a key player in the European medicinal cannabis industry as well,&#8221; said Costanzo, &#8220;a country from which to access other European jurisdictions.&#8221;</p>

<p>The <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> industry is set to reach yet another milestone this week. While we won&#8217;t see the passing of any new legislation or any states announcing legalization, the plant has still managed to nudge its way further into the mainstream, with one Canadian marijuana company to be listed on the NASDAQ, beginning Tuesday.</p>
<h2>Cronos Makes History</h2>
<p>Cronos Group Inc., a cannabis company that already trades on the Canadian Stock Exchange, is set to become the first marijuana company to appear on a major U.S. exchange. Shares will be available to trade on the NASDAQ beginning&#160;Tuesday.</p>
<p>Cronos founder and chief executive officer&#160;Mike Gorenstein believe this isn&#8217;t just a massive victory for his own company, but for the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very significant for the company and the whole industry,&#8221; Gorenstein said in <a href="http://business.financialpost.com/investing/nasdaq-to-get-first-pot-listing-as-cronos-group-joins-exchange" rel="nofollow">an interview with the <em>Financial Post</em></a>.&#160;&#8220;It&#8217;s a huge moment&#8212;just shows the stigma is continuing to erode on cannabis.&#8221;</p>
<p>In Canada, medical marijuana has been federally legal since 2001, and the country is set to legalize recreational marijuana sometime in the fall after <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/recreational-marijuana-canada-delayed/">the original July 1st deadline was pushed back by lawmakers</a>. On the flip side, the plant remains federally illegal in the U.S., with 29 individual states allowing it for medicinal purposes, and just nine states (as well as the District of Columbia) recreationally.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Not to mention the fact that Jeff Sessions recently <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/jeff-sessions-anti-pot-federal-crackdown-full-force/">nixed Obama-era&#160;protections</a> that allowed state-legal industries to create cannabis laws without government&#160;interferences. This has caused some prominent U.S. investors to think twice about investing in the Green Rush. According to Gorenstein, U.S. sanctions are what caused&#160;him to relocate his company to Canada in the first place.</p>
<p>However, Gorenstein&#160;expects that his company&#8217;s move to the NASDAQ could cause hesitant investors to change their tune.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of U.S. investors still are unsure about the legality: There&#8217;s not a lot of awareness about the fact that it&#8217;s federally legal in Canada versus the U.S.,&#8221; he said. &#8220;By listing on Nasdaq, it will open up the opportunities for a lot of U.S. investors that otherwise were unsure&#8212;even on the institutional level.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;Canadian Marijuana Company To Be Listed On The NASDAQ</h2>
<p>Despite its current federal status in the U.S., Gorenstein hopes to eventually expand his business into the U.S. Currently, Cronos is working on building a growing facility in Israel and has received a license through a joint venture in Australia.</p>
<p>And while Cronos will become the first to trade on the U.S. Stock Exchange, it isn&#8217;t the first Canadian cannabis stock with U.S. ties. Back in October, <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/corona-invests-marijuana-green-rush/">Constellation Brands</a>, which brews Corona beer, invested a whopping $191 million in the Canadian cannabis company Canopy growth.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>&#8220;This move is a complete game changer, not only for Canopy but also for the entire industry,&#8221;&#160;Eight Capital analyst Daniel Pearlstein said at the time.</p>
<p>He certainly wasn&#8217;t wrong. After falling 7.3 percentage points over the fiscal year, Cronos shares were up as much as 11 percent following Mondays&#8217; news. U.S. investors are clearly interested in getting in on the Green Rush from the ground floor. If more and more legal Canadian cannabis companies continue to make its way on to the U.S. exchange, it could prime marijuana investors for a big payday.</p>
<p>But right now, it&#8217;s up to the federal government to allow that happen.</p>

<p>If approved, Idahoans seeking to use the oil for medical purposes for themselves or their minor children would have to apply to the Idaho Board of Pharmacy for a cannabidiol registration card.</p>
<p>Cannabidiol, otherwise known as CBD oil, comes from cannabis but contain little or no THC.</p>
<p>Currently, 18 states allow use of &#8220;low THC, high cannabidiol (CBD)&#8221; products for medical reasons in limited situations or as a legal defense.</p>
<p>Gov. C.L. &#8220;Butch&#8221; Otter vetoed similar legislation in 2015 that would have allowed children with severe forms of epilepsy to use CBD oil.</p>
<p>House members on Wednesday passed the measure on a 59-11 vote. It must now pass the Senate before it can head to the governor&#8217;s desk.</p>

<p>Recreational <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> isn&#8217;t even legal in New Jersey. Yet while lawmakers debate what, if any, marijuana legislation they want to introduce, some municipalities are already deciding for them. Over the past few months, a groundswell of anti-cannabis advocacy has coincided with a number of cities opting out of a legal-weed future. Continuing a trend set by Point Pleasant Beach last December, these New Jersey Towns are preemptively banning cannabis businesses.</p>
<h2>The Towns</h2>
<p>Middleton Township, Wall Township, towns in Monmouth County and Ocean County like Berkeley and Toms River, Seaside Heights and several other towns across <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/legalization/will-new-jersey-be-next-state-legalize-marijuana/">New Jersey</a> have all voted or are planning to vote to <a href="https://www.app.com/story/money/business/main-street/2018/02/22/middletown-nj-marijuana-weed-ban/357621002/" rel="nofollow">ban cannabis businesses</a>.</p>
<p>Some are also passing ordinances banning farms and manufacturing facilities in addition to dispensaries. Officials in these areas are also vocally opposing legalization efforts.</p>
<p>Counties&#8217; opposition to legal weed is for the most part symbolic. But the official positions of county boards can be influential in shaping the stance its towns ultimately take.</p>
<p>Ocean County, for example, has passed a resolution opposing marijuana legalization and encouraging towns to make the same call.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Pro-cannabis advocacy groups have been somewhat taken by surprise at the sudden surge in opposition to legalization. The earliest New Jersey could vote on a legal recreational measure is June 30 of this year.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why president of the New Jersey Cannabusiness Association Scott Rudder called the opposition &#8220;premature.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even though these New Jersey towns are preemptively banning cannabis businesses, other towns in the state have eagerly and enthusiastically <a href="http://www.nj.com/marijuana/2018/01/leaders_of_two_nj_towns_say_theyre_open_to_weed_sa.html" rel="nofollow">embraced</a> the possibility of legalization.</p>
<h2>New Jersey Towns Take Opposing Positions On Legal Weed</h2>
<p>In a January tweet, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop expressed his support for legalization. Fulop is also beginning to work with the city&#8217;s planning department and local residents to establish clear zoning rules for cannabis businesses.</p>
<p>City officials in Asbury Park, including Mayor John Moor and Deputy Mayor Amy Quinn, have also come out in support of legal weed businesses. &#8220;We don&#8217;t have an issue if it&#8217;s regulated and taxed,&#8221; Quinn said. Indeed, a <a href="https://www.aclu-nj.org/news/2016/05/24/marijuana-legalization-would-bring-100s-millions-nj-tax-reve" rel="nofollow">recent report</a> by New Jersey United for Marijuana Reform estimated that a 25 percent tax on cannabis at the point of sale would provide about $300 million in the first year.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>Both Jersey City and Asbury Park are among the more <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/everything-you-need-to-know-about-new-jerseys-pot-laws/">high-profile destinations in New Jersey</a>. Their openness to a legal cannabis program may help overcome the opposition from other towns in the state.</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;These New Jersey Towns Are Preemptively Banning Cannabis Businesses</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not unusual for particular towns to enact <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/3-years-after-legalization-alaska-communities-weigh-pot-bans/">bans on cannabis businesses</a> despite state-wide legalization. Usually, however, towns wait until after a legalization measure passes, or at least until lawmakers propose one.</p>
<p>But opponents of legal cannabis in New Jersey have their work cut out for them. <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/governor-new-jersey-ending-prohibition/">Governor Phil Murphy</a> has vowed to sign a legalization bill in his first 100 days in office. Gov. Murphy is an outspoken advocate of cannabis who made legalization a major part of his platform.</p>
<p>The most recent proposal, legislation co-sponsored by state Sen. Ronald Rice, <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/new-jersey-favoring-decriminalizing-marijuana-legalization/">aims at a compromise</a>. The bill proposes to decriminalize, but not outright legalize cannabis. Rice is also skeptical of arguments that tax money from cannabis sales can solve &#8220;the woes of the state&#8221;. Other residents hesitant to embrace legalization argue that dispensaries profit off of vulnerable communities and individuals.</p>

<p>The Coffee Joint soon can allow customers to vape or consume edibles they bring to the caf&#233; at 1130 Yuma Court, in the Lincoln Park neighborhood. No smoking will be allowed and the shop can&#8217;t sell any marijuana products.</p>
<p>The approval of first-of-its-kind license wraps a busy February for Denver&#8217;s efforts to enact Initiative 300, the <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2016/11/14/initiative-300-social-pot-use-denver/67596/">2016 voter-approved ballot measure allowing social marijuana use</a>.</p>
<p>After filing <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/12/11/denver-marijuana-club-coffee-joint-application/94307/">the first application</a> for a social use permit last December, The Coffee Joint made their <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/02/09/denver-marijuana-club-coffee-joint/98672/">initial public pitch</a> to Denver officialson Feb. 9. No opponents of the business spoke during the two-hour hearing and a representative for the Lincoln Park neighborhood asked the city for approval. A Denver attorney that oversaw the hearing <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/02/15/denver-marijuana-club-coffee-joint-attorney/99160/">recommended</a> on Feb. 14 that the city approve the proposal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the backers of <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/02/09/denver-marijuana-spa-utopia/98532/">a proposed marijuana spa filed the second-ever application</a> for a Denver social use license on Feb. 7. Utopia All Natural Wellness Spa and Lounge submitted its application for a spa in the Creswell Mansion, 1244 Grant St. &#8212; just blocks from Colorado&#8217;s state Capitol.</p>
<p>The spa&#8217;s application will receive a public hearing within 60 days, Utopia founder and CEO Cindy Sovine <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/02/09/denver-marijuana-spa-utopia/98532/">told The Cannabist</a>. If approved, her estimated timeline for receiving the permit to operate the spa is around 90 days.</p>
<p>I-300 was approved by 54 percent of Denver voters in November 2016, but the city <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/08/24/denver-social-marijuana-clubs-applications/86727/">didn&#8217;t start accepting applications until August 2017</a>.</p>
<p>Proponents contend that city officials&#160;<a href="http://href=" https:>added too many hassles</a>&#160;for potential applicants. Those include location restrictions that made potential applicants in many areas of the city ineligible because they are within 1,000 feet of schools, alcohol and drug treatment centers, and child-care facilities. State-imposed restrictions on businesses with liquor licenses also&#160;make it <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2016/11/18/no-social-pot-use-bars-denver-marijuana-laws-initiative-300/67965/">more difficult for bars to apply</a>.</p>

<p>The tribes floated the idea of setting up rival farms and sales shops on reservations after concluding that rules requiring them to be licensed by the state would strip them of authority over their own lands and their right to self-governance.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/report-99-of-california-cannabis-growers-are-still-unlicensed"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/19161117/1-percent-farms-licensed-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Report: 99% of California Cannabis Growers Are Still Unlicensed</div></div></a></div>
<p>The possibility of the tribes breaking away from the state-run system is one more challenge for California as it attempts to transform its longstanding medicinal and illegal marijuana markets into a unified, multibillion-dollar industry.</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">California has over 100 federally recognized tribes, the most of any state.</div>
<p>For tribes to participate in the state-run market, &#8220;they have to give up their rights to act as governments, with regard to cannabis,&#8221; said Mark Levitan, a tribal attorney.</p>
<p>At issue are legally thorny questions about who governs whom, taxation and the intersection of state marijuana laws with tribes that the federal government recognizes as sovereign nations within the U.S.</p>
<p>Under regulations issued last year, California would retain full control over licensing. Tribes would have to follow state rules, including &#8220;submission to all enforcement,&#8221; to obtain a license to grow or sell marijuana. Any application must include a waiver of &#8220;sovereign immunity,&#8221; a sort of legal firewall that protects tribal interests.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/report-from-the-front-the-trouble-with-cannabis-in-indian-country"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/23201550/report-from-the-front-the-trouble-with-cannabis-in-indian-country-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Report from the Front: The Trouble with Cannabis in Indian Country</div></div></a></div>
<p>Without state licenses, businesses cannot take part in the legal state marijuana market. California has over 100 federally recognized tribes, the most of any state, and estimates of the number either growing and selling cannabis or eager to do so varies, from a handful to over 20.</p>
<p>Unlike those that have prospered from casino gambling, some are in struggling rural areas and would welcome a new source of cash to improve schools and pave roads.</p>
<p>After long-running negotiations between tribes and state officials failed to produce an agreement before broad legal sales began Jan. 1, the California Native American Cannabis Association warned state officials that tribes &#8220;may engage in commercial cannabis activities through our own inherent sovereign authority.&#8221;</p>
<p>If tribes choose to step away from California&#8217;s market, &#8220;the state will have no jurisdiction to enforce its cannabis laws and regulations on tribal lands,&#8221; the group said in a sharply worded letter to Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown&#8217;s administration in December.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/california-sends-several-hundred-warning-letters-to-unlicensed-cannabis-businesses"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/16150453/unlicensed-dispensaries-california-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">California Sends &#8216;Several Hundred&#8217; Warning Letters to Unlicensed Cannabis Businesses</div></div></a></div>
<p>Tribes &#8220;just want to be able to do business in the state of California and elsewhere, just like anybody else,&#8221; said Paul Chavez, former chairman of the Bishop Paiute tribe.</p>
<p>The dispute in California differs from another legal cannabis state, Washington, where seven tribes have marijuana compacts with the state and others are in negotiations or awaiting the governor&#8217;s approval. The compacts allow tribal marijuana businesses to participate in the legal system, such as selling tribe-grown cannabis to retailers off the reservation.</p>
<p>In California, the tribes are circulating a proposal that calls for the governor to strike agreements with them. Those pacts would allow them to participate in the legal market, while the state would recognize a tribe&#8217;s &#8220;exclusive authority&#8221; to regulate commercial marijuana activity on its lands.</p>
<p>Tribes are eager for a settlement, but reaching a deal in the Legislature could take the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone agrees conceptually there should be an even playing field, a level playing field,&#8221; said state Assemblyman Rob Bonta, a Democrat at the center of the negotiations in Sacramento.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/california-scrambles-to-speed-sluggish-cannabis-criminal-expungement-process"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/22153817/SF-Expungement-Header-01-480x300.png"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">California Scrambles to Speed Sluggish Expungement Process</div></div></a></div>
<p>In addition to the problems in Sacramento, tribes are facing uncertainty at the federal level.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions lifted an Obama-era policy that kept federal authorities from cracking down on the marijuana trade in states where the drug is legal, which also guided enforcement on tribal lands.</p>
<p>The shifting ground has put a chill over development plans &#8212; including in an isolated stretch of eastern San Diego County.</p>
<p>Nevada-based GB Sciences Inc. announced last year that it would build and manage a commercial cannabis company on tribal lands, nurturing plants, manufacturing products and distributing them across the state.</p>
<p>The tribe, the Los Coyotes Band of Cahuilla and Cupeno Indians, would get an ownership stake, jobs and 40 percent of the profits. GB Sciences would get income for its marijuana research and a foothold in the largest legal cannabis market in the U.S.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/court-native-american-church-not-excused-from-cannabis-laws"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/23202708/court-native-american-church-not-excused-from-cannabis-laws-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Court: Native American Church Not Excused From Cannabis Laws</div></div></a></div>
<p>But the projected $8 million project is on hold, with the status of tribes in the marijuana market unclear.</p>
<p>Issues involving sovereignty touch a sensitive subject for tribes, and they see the predicament with marijuana as part of a history of exploitation.</p>
<p>The state rule &#8220;harkens back to the end of the 19th century &#8230; when federal and state policies favored extermination or forced assimilation of California tribes,&#8221; the tribal group wrote.</p>

<p>The incidents of Transportation Security Administration officials discovering marijuana on passengers are so few and far between that DIA stopped tracking those contacts and sees no need for so-called &#8220;amnesty boxes&#8221; in which flyers can dispose of their federally illegal weed, said airport spokesman Heath Montgomery.</p>
<p>In Las Vegas, where recreational marijuana was legalized last July, McCarran International Airport earlier this month <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/02/22/marijuana-amnesty-boxes-airport-las-vegas/99771/">installed 10 green amnesty boxes</a> so that passengers jetting out of Sin City can dump their leftover legal marijuana. Two airports in Colorado &#8212; Aspen-Pitkin County and <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2014/12/01/airport-marijuana-amnesty-boxes-rarely-used-weed-disposal/24339/">Colorado Springs</a> &#8212; already have similar disposal bins in place.</p>

<p>But in the four-plus years since Colorado initiated adult-use cannabis sales, DIA has been &#8220;very successful with not having to do that,&#8221; Montgomery said of the secured disposal bins.</p>
<p>DIA banned marijuana possession, consumption and use on the expansive, 53-square-mile airport property <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2013/12/29/dia-first-denver-facility-to-ban-marijuana-possession/">at the time</a> Colorado implemented legal recreational marijuana sales in January 2014, Montgomery said. Signs were installed to inform people of the airport&#8217;s regulations and also to remind them that marijuana remains federally illegal and, as such, can&#8217;t be taken on planes. </p>
<p>In January 2015, <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2015/01/28/denver-airport-bans-marijuana-souvenirs/28748/">DIA banned the sale of marijuana-themed souvenirs</a> to enforce that message. </p>
<p>&#8220;I think people got the message loud and clear that they were not supposed to fly with the drug,&#8221; Montgomery said.</p>
<p>In the first couple of years after legalization, DIA saw about 30 to 40 incidents out of 50 million-plus passenger trips, Montgomery said. Last year, the airport saw <a href="https://www.flydenver.com/sites/default/files/downloads/18-006%20Dec%20Pax%20Traffic.pdf">a record 61.4 million passengers</a>, yet the number of those flyers found with marijuana continues to be &#8220;minuscule&#8221; to the point it&#8217;s not worth the police officers&#8217; time to draft up incident reports, he said.</p>
<p>If TSA officials find marijuana on a passenger, they contact Denver Police officers who then determine if the amount found was for the passenger&#8217;s personal use or large enough to be considered illegal trafficking. If the former, the passenger is informed of the airport&#8217;s policy and given the option to throw it away or return the product home.</p>
<p>There are trashcans at TSA checkpoints where people can dispose of restricted items, including marijuana.</p>
<p>&#8220;Generally speaking, people don&#8217;t dig into trashcans at an international airport, Montgomery said. &#8220;That&#8217;s not an advisable activity.&#8221;</p>
<p>DIA has seen success with the rules in place, Montgomery said.</p>
<p>&#8220;At a higher level, people just understand they&#8217;re not supposed to fly with marijuana,&#8221; he said.</p>

The players union did not respond to the league, who has been notoriously reluctant to budge on marijuana, among other things including concussion research.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instead, NFL teams and their doctors continue to dole out loads of prescription painkillers, putting people at risk for addiction and further complications later in life after their career is over. When Marijuana.com spoke with </span><a href="https://www.marijuana.com/news/2016/11/ricky-williams-on-espns-nfl-painkiller-survey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Ricky Williams</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> about the league&#8217;s rampant use of Toradol, a drug meant only to be administered short term in low doses &#8212; and not to anyone with a head injury &#8212; his response was revealing.</span></p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Other players and I became dependent on it. If we didn&#8217;t have it daily, practice was a nightmare because we were in so much pain &#8230; When I played, I smoked marijuana to manage the pain, which required me to be proactive about taking care of my body. Using Toradol makes it easy to depend on the pill or the shot to feel better.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We told Ricky about the information we found regarding a 5-day maximum on continuous Toradol injections and he quickly pointed out that those guidelines didn&#8217;t apply in the NFL.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Football players who are prescribed Toradol use it daily for the entire season,&#8221; answered Williams.</span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Currently, NFL players are screened for marijuana use and face strict discipline, including the </span><a href="https://www.marijuana.com/news/2017/05/repeated-weed-offender-josh-gordon-denied-nfl-reinstatement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">derailment of their career</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, if they are found to be using cannabis for any reason.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Authorized use of marijuana would have changed my career drastically,&#8221; Ricky Williams told Marijuana.com.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another former player who was tired of being told what to take and how to treat his body by team-paid physicians literally took healing into his own hands. Toward the end of his playing career, Herve Damas became fascinated with health and wellness &#8212; a passion that subsequently fueled his desire to become a doctor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;My journey into medicine actually started curiously enough when I was with the Buffalo Bills. I suffered what&#8217;s referred to as a &#8216;terrible triad&#8217; injury, tearing my ACL, MCL, and PCL, as well as meniscus damage,&#8221; Dr. Damas explained. &#8220;It ended my career and my childhood dream was gone.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once the realization set in that football isn&#8217;t forever, Damas faced even more surgeries, which meant a constant uphill battle of recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I was so interested in what was going on with my body that I was pestering the physicians with questions when one of them, Richard Weiss, the orthopedic surgeon for the Bills at the time, told me I should become a doctor. I still thought I was going to play football for another ten years. He patted me on the shoulder and said, &#8216;sure you are.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With serious medical procedures came prescription pain remedies and serious implications such as troubling side effects and the insurmountable likelihood of addiction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;After surgery, there was a typical outcome: opioid prescriptions. I could not take them &#8212; they made me feel terrible, worse than the pain itself. My wife said, &#8216;Hey, you should really smoke a joint and chill out,&#8217;&#8221; Damas said. &#8220;I had never considered it before because of penalties during my football career plus the social stigma. After two years of chronic pain and pills, I called a fellow med student and said, &#8216;Do you know where I can get some stuff?&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<h3><b>A Whole New Set of Downs</b></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I finally smoked cannabis and my world opened up. I could sleep and all of my psychological issues and sleeping problems felt alleviated. Five years later, here I am, a part of the industry.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It didn&#8217;t take long for the naturally nurturing Damas to realize he could help others heal with the knowledge and experience he gained in treating his pain with medical marijuana.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Once medical marijuana was passed in Florida, I knew I wanted to help fellow athletes. I went to a retired players chapter meeting and said, &#8216;okay, here&#8217;s what I want to do.&#8217; I established a small population of NFL players and their families and there was an overwhelming response,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Stories and messages poured in detailing stories of cognitive impairment, early dementia, etc. Everything you hear about with football players, I saw for myself. Blowing my knee out saved me in a way and allowed me to be in a different space. I empathize with them though. I suffered too.&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From his experience as a professional athlete, Damas was well versed in locker room pain relief techniques that, for many, included opioids which, as many professional athletes tell it, are passed out like candy from the team physicians.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I can say most players really do not like prescription drugs. In fact, they literally hate them and the way the pills make them feel physically. They fear the addictive potential of the opioids, so guys will drink alcohol or try to self-medicate with marijuana,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Players understand they are a commodity more than a person in the eyes of the league and the team-hired doctors.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><iframe width="702" height="395" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/umkdU_Cyf04?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Damas realized many were using marijuana as an alternative form of treatment already, he wanted to study it further to understand how it could truly revolutionize sports medicine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Damas studied pre-medicine at Florida International University, got his MBA in Health/Healthcare Administration and Management from Davenport University and obtained an MD from the Medical University of the Americas. He is currently involved in a research study to explore the benefits of CBD for elite athletes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I am working with Martha Montemayor and the Cannabis Clinicians of Colorado on a study that will evaluate the effects of CBD as a pain management tool for former elite-level athletes including football, hockey, and even a few basketball players,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Although each sport entails different levels of physical damage, the overarching problem is chronic pain. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The study will use CBD medicine provided by four companies and will include nasal sprays, sublingual, and gel caps. The research team will examine brain activity and brain wave changes in the players before, during, and after administration. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Studies have shown that men who have chronic pain reported their marijuana usage halted prescriptions opioid use,&#8221; Damas said. &#8220;The hope is that by pounding down the doors of the different leagues with data, the science will speak for itself.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Damas believes cannabis can offer not only a solution for pain but also the mental toll pain and addiction can take on a person&#8217;s life.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Patients are receptive and usually come to me with troubling stories of suffering. When you consider someone who has been dealing with the kind of severe pain that most people have not ever experienced, mental health becomes a major issue. This is not just about smoking to get high and have fun, it&#8217;s about real medical issues. For a player, it becomes a choice between a normal life and watching it disintegrate.&#8221;</span></p>

<p>The complaint filed in the Southern District of New York <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/07/25/marijuana-schedule-i-lawsuit-unconstitutional/84473/">last July</a> challenged the constitutionality of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) as it pertains to marijuana.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs, including an Iraq War veteran, a child with a seizure disorder and an ex-NFL player, claimed that the CSA&#8217;s classification of cannabis as a Schedule I substance &#8212; a designation reserved for the most dangerous substances including heroin, LSD and mescaline &#8212; is so &#8220;irrational&#8221; that it violates the U.S. Constitution.</p>
<p>Federal Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein on Monday dismissed Washington, et.al v. Sessions, et.al, the plaintiffs&#8217; attorney Michael S. Hiller announced in a statement.</p>

<p>In dismissing the case, Hellerstein took pains to &#8220;emphasize that this decision is not on the merits of plaintiffs&#8217; claim[s],&#8221; Hiller said, quoting the ruling. </p>
<p>Instead, the judge decided that the plaintiffs were first required to exhaust administrative remedies &#8212; petition the DEA to reschedule cannabis, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Resigning the plaintiffs to the petitioning administrative process is tantamount to a death sentence for those patients who need cannabis to live,&#8221; Hiller said in the statement. &#8220;The time has come for the courts to abandon decades-old precedent, notched with obsolete legal technicalities, and catch up with modern science and contemporary principles of constitutional law.&#8221;</p>
<p>During Feb. 14 oral arguments in the case, the government claimed that the plaintiffs had not petitioned the DEA to reclassify marijuana, <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/02/14/marijuana-schedule-i-lawsuit-trial/98979/">the Associated Press reported</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;When agencies are set up to do the very thing that you want me to do, the right thing to do is defer to the agency,&#8221; Hellerstein told Hiller.</p>
<p>During the hearing Hillerstein did show sympathy for the plaintiffs&#8217; claims that medical marijuana has helped them.</p>
<p>&#8220;How could anyone say that your clients&#8217; lives have not been saved by marijuana?&#8221; Hellerstein said.</p>
<p>Hiller on Monday vowed to appeal the decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;This case will continue to move forward,&#8221; he said &#8220;Notwithstanding the outcome today, we remain confident that the final disposition of this case will include a finding that the classification of cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act is unconstitutional &#8211; freeing millions of Americans to safely treat their conditions with a plant that maintains their health and their lives.&#8221;</p>

<p>The five-member Cannabis Control Commission voted Monday to postpone licensing home deliveries and the cafes until the fall while pushing forward to finalize regulations allowing the commercial sale of the drug in Massachusetts by July 1.<br>
Republican Gov. Charlie Baker and law enforcement officials have voiced opposition to allowing pot cafes, saying they could pose a risk to public safety and public health.</p>
<p>Supporters of the voter-approved law legalizing recreational marijuana in Massachusetts say there&#8217;s nothing unusual about licensing cafes where patrons could gather and legally use marijuana with friends.</p>

					<p><span style="font-weight: 400">CANNABIS CULTURE &#8211; The Holy Land is home to some spectacular scenery, but no vista in the country can lay claim to sunrises as majestic as those of the Egyptian Sinai. Standing on the shoreline of the Gulf of Aqaba, locals and visitors alike gaze to the East and watch the sun emerge above the mountain range on the Saudi Arabian side of the seawater inlet, unobstructed by any man-made structure.</span><span id="more-69800"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The name &#8216;Red&#8217; in &#8220;Red Sea&#8217; may be derivative of its Hebrew name, &#8216;Reed Sea&#8217;, so called for the seaweed that grows in abundance in its tropical waters. But red also describes the stunning hues of the cliffs that run along its entire east coast, from Jordan in the north down to Yemen in the south, where its waters spill into the Gulf of Aden, the Arabian Sea, and from there, into the Indian Ocean.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Standing at the water&#8217;s edge, anyone could be forgiven for losing track of time, forgetting their stresses, and drifting into oblivion &#8211; all the more so if one was smoking some of the local herb. The indica strains that can be easily acquired at Bedouin encampments on the Sinai coast are not especially potent, but they are plentiful and inexpensive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a blissful four-day break on the beach with his paramour, 30-year-old graphic designer Elyasaf decided it was time to head back north, to return to the rigors of his regular life in Tel Aviv.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He never made it past Egyptian border control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Today I remind you of my sins,&#8221; Elyasaf confessed to Cannabis Culture, recalling the terrifying turn of events that followed. The quote from scripture (Genesis 41:9) was a reminder of his ultra-Orthodox upbringing, and a reference to the Biblical figure Joseph being tossed into an Egyptian jail, a fate he was about to experience himself.</span></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-69803 alignleft" src="https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/A2-350x280.jpg" alt="" width="635" height="508" srcset="https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/A2-350x280.jpg 350w, https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/A2.jpg 564w" sizes="(max-width: 635px) 100vw, 635px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I had a packet for holding tobacco,&#8221; says Elyasaf. &#8220;And marijuana had been put in the packet. It wasn&#8217;t a whole lot, but it wasn&#8217;tso little, either. I arrive at the border. At that moment, when I remembered that I had it on me, and I wanted to throw it out, it wasn&#8217;t possible any more. I was next to the Egyptian soldiers.&#8221;</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The customs officials examined Elyasaf&#8217;s luggage and found the packet that contained the sensimilia. &#8220;He took out the tobacco packet, and opened it. He looked inside and was totally surprised. &#8216;Where did you get this good quality stuff?&#8217; He really enjoyed sniffing it, several times. &#8216;Where in Egypt can you get these things nowadays?&#8217; And then: &#8216;You&#8217;re going to go to jail for years.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Egyptian officers then transferred Elyasaf to a holding center nearby, where conditions could not have been more different from the Bedouin beach utopia he had just departed from only an hour earlier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;You enter a place that is something like a hole in the ground. You are immediately blinded. There was constant blinding light, 24 hours a day, with a vent that also makes a crazy, horrible noise, 24 hours a day as well,&#8221; says Elyasaf. &#8220;The cell was separated into two rooms. One of the rooms, you don&#8217;t want to enter it, you don&#8217;t want to smell what goes on there, you don&#8217;t want to see the rats, and even a snake.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Entering the cell for the first time, Elyasaf started to take stock of his miserable circumstances. &#8220;At first I blink my eyes and I try to see. And I see just one figure in the room, lying on the ground at first. And he gets up, it&#8217;s a dark-skinned young man with knotted hair,&#8221; recalled Elyasaf.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;A few seconds passed before I realized that the guy is talking to me in Hebrew! In fluent Hebrew, Israeli in every way, without a hint of an accent! So I said, &#8216;Hey, what are you doing here? How did you get here?&#8217; And then he tells me his unbelievable crazy story.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><b>Kidnapped in broad daylight in downtown Tel Aviv</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back in Tel Aviv, Ablel said goodbye to his friend Semere and hailed a private taxi. &#8220;I spoke the language well,&#8221; he told Cannabis Culture. &#8220;I told him where to take me and where to bring me back.&#8221; As requested, the cabbie ferried him to one of the private financial institutions serving the African refugee community and other foreigners who are often prevented from opening regular bank accounts in Israel. Ablel made his deposits and returned to the taxi, still waiting for him outside.</span></p>
<p><img class=" wp-image-69801 alignleft" src="https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/B3-350x261.jpg" alt="" width="463" height="345" srcset="https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/B3-350x261.jpg 350w, https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/B3.jpg 960w, https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/B3-350x261@2x.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 463px) 100vw, 463px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;He&#8217;d been calling around while I was gone, until I came back. He&#8217;d been calling around. I didn&#8217;t even think about who he could be calling, didn&#8217;t even think about it. My mind was elsewhere,&#8221; says Ablel. &#8220;He told me there was also another person he would pick up that was also going around where he was dropping me off, so he wanted to pick him up.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is not uncommon for Israeli cab drivers to make this request of their customers, so Ablel didn&#8217;t think much of it at the time. But as soon as the second passenger entered the vehicle, his malicious intentions were made apparent. Ablel was violently attacked and his face sprayed with a noxious poison that temporarily blinded him and rendered him unconscious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was then whisked right out of the country.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ablel&#8217;s captors drove him down to the desert and dumped him in a dark ditch. After what felt like a day or two &#8211; he could not be sure as he was held in isolation &#8211; Ablel was fished out of the pit and forcibly taken to the Egyptian border.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">There, at the border fence, he was transferred to another set of captors. &#8220;People were being welcomed by the types who buy and sell,&#8221; Ablel recalls. &#8220;I was hearing about how they take people into Sinai and Sudan and stuff like that, but I never thought that kind of thing would happen to me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ablel was then held for months in a shipping container in the Sinai, not far from the border with Israel. &#8220;They started telling me to talk,&#8221; Ablel remembers, &#8220;and began the torture.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><b>Torture camps just across the border from Israel</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Ablel&#8217;s friends fretted over his fate, he was forced to endure physical tortures for months, and to witness the torture of several other Eritrean refugees he was held with, just teenagers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For decades, Bedouin tribes across northeast Africa had smuggled goods across national borders, including human cargo. When the number of Eritrean nationals trying to cross the Sinai Peninsula and enter Israel increased exponentially in the late 2000&#8217;s, not all of their Bedouin smugglers contented themselves with charging the refugees a simple fee to transport them to the border. Some of these gangs began to torture the refugees in the most gruesome ways, hoping to extract from them even more money.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We have a culture of collecting money, funding things. Whenever we hear an Eritrean has a problem, we are always raising money for different issues. And this made it easy,.&#8221; Swedish-Eritrean journalist Meron Estefanos told Cannabis Culture. &#8220;We have become like goods!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition to the predictable set of abuses &#8211; beatings, electrocutions, and rapes &#8211; these gangs also invented a new type of torture to further torment their captives: melting hot plastic and dripping it onto the bare skin of their hapless victims, causing immense pain and leaving ugly scars. The smugglers would then force the refugees to call up their relatives in other parts of the world and plead with them to transfer tens of thousands of dollars to the smugglers&#8217; bank accounts. Only upon receiving payment for the full sums &#8211; large by Eritrean standards &#8211; would the smugglers release the refugees and shepherd them to the border with Israel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just a few weeks before Ablel was snatched and smuggled into the Sinai, Estefanos visited the peninsula to document the ongoing abuses. There she met and interviewed some of the very Bedouins who trafficked and tortured African refugees, and asked them why they did it. &#8220;They give you different reasons,&#8221; recalls Estefanos. &#8220;One would say, because they were tortured themselves by [the then-recently deposed ruler of Egypt for thirty years, Hosni]Mubarak, and this is what they have learned. Others will say, there are no jobs in the economy in the Sinai.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Other Bedouins she spoke to weren&#8217;t ashamed of their behavior and didn&#8217;t attempt to excuse it. &#8220;Somebody actually told me, these are not human beings, we see them as cattle,&#8221; says Estefanos. &#8220;I asked them, &#8216;But even if you see them as cattle, you don&#8217;t torture animals!&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is difficult to find an Eritrean national in Israel today who was not either tortured by these human traffickers, or forced to witness them torturing others, or pressured to contribute significant sums of money to secure the release of family members and friends. The knowledge that so many of their countrymen suffered these unspeakable horrors, and that many more were forced into complicity, remains a source of great pain and great shame to Eritreans in Israel.</span></p>
<p><b>&#8216;Tortured without mercy&#8217; for months in a shipping container</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The torture Ablel endured still traumatizes him, but in a series of interviews with Cannabis Culture, he reluctantly dredged up memories of the horrific abuse he suffered. &#8220;They hit my neck, my jaw and my mouth,&#8221; says Ablel. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t talk or say anything. I was just straight crying.&#8221; The beatings went on for two months straight, he says. &#8220;It was hurting me, but then I got numb as it went on. They treated me however they wanted. They&#8217;d hit me whenever they came around,&#8221; Ablel remembers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His daily diet consisted of just half of a pita bread, and he had no choice but to go to the bathroom in the same shipping container he was being held in, along with other prisoners. And in addition to the torments that he himself suffered, Ablel was also forced to witness his captors abusing the other Eritrean refugees. His jailers &#8220;tortured without mercy,&#8221; he says, burning their backs and lopping one young man&#8217;s ear clean off his head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ablel&#8217;s captors demanded $35,000 for his release, a princely sum. But his initial kidnappers had mistakenly left his mobile phone back in Israel, and without the device, Ablel couldn&#8217;t be sure of his family members&#8217; phone numbers. &#8220;I would start thinking to remember the numbers, but I&#8217;d mix them up and give it to them incorrectly. It wouldn&#8217;t work for them. Whenever that would happen, they would hit me,&#8221; says Ablel. &#8220;After some time, I didn&#8217;t have any capacity to sustain it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After about eight weeks, the fates finally granted Ablel a reprieve from his daily tortures. One of his captors removed him from the shipping container he was being held in, and walked him up a high hill. There he hoped Ablel would get better cellphone reception, so that he could call up a family member and plead for a ransom payment. But as they climbed up the steep hill, Ablel glimpsed an opportunity to flee from his captors. With a sudden movement, he shifted his weight, shoving the guard down the hill, and then making a break for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though his health had seriously deteriorated, Ablel still managed to escape on foot. He walked and walked through the desert, until he came to a road, where he collapsed in a heap. &#8220;When I got to the street, I just sat there and waited. I was waiting for a car. It was almost night. Some would see me and pass. Motorcycles would pass. They&#8217;d drive by and keep going.&#8221; After about six hours, someone took pity on him, and called the police for help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After two months of torture, Ablel made for a harrowing sight. His clothes amounted to not much more than ripped rags scarcely covering his gaunt frame, replete with open wounds. &#8220;I&#8217;d cut the sleeves so that I could wrap the bloody wounds,&#8221; he recalls.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">He was now free but in foreign territory, lacking documents that could attest to his identity and to his legal status, and without the support of a sovereign state that would vouch for him. The Egyptian police put Ablel a decrepit cell just a couple of kilometers from the Israeli border.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And there he languished for months, until one day, Elyasaf entered the cell.</span></p>

However, as it stands, most cannabis-legal states do not have a set of rules, or even, a <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/legalization/massachusetts-roadside-sobriety-tests-for-weed/">viable way to accurately test drivers for cannabis consumption</a>. Now, lawmakers in California are considering a set of regulations for one sector of the cannabis consumer community&#8212;underage users. Which begs the question: could drivers under 21 lose their license if caught with marijuana?</p>
<h2>A New Initiative</h2>

<p>California drivers under the age of 21 could lose their license for a year due to new regulations. Getting caught driving with cannabis could result in a year of hitchhiking and public transportation.</p>
<p>Much like alcohol, California residents must be 21 or over to purchase and legally consume pot.&#160;State Sen. Jerry Hill (D-San Mateo) explained that the upcoming provisions will also closely mirror pre-existing legislation. Especially when it comes to underage drinking and driving.</p>
<p>He added that &#8220;the state will adhere to a strict &#8216;zero-tolerance''&#8221; policy.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

		</div>

<p>&#8220;This bill will save lives by making it illegal for drivers under age 21 to drive under the influence of marijuana, just like current law for alcohol,&#8221; <a href="http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-california-drivers-under-21-could-lose-1519152065-htmlstory.html" rel="nofollow">Sen. Hill said in a statement</a>.</p>
<p>The proposed bill, titled SB 1273, would test drivers suspected of driving under the influence of cannabis for delta-9- <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/science/thc-tetrahydrocannabinol/">THC</a>, the main psychoactive component of marijuana.</p>
<p>However, this remains a challenge as the state does not have a way to measure the plant in the body. Nor do they have a way of determining a unified standard for impairment</p>
<div>
<div>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have a device in the field to measure impairment by cannabis,&#8221; said the California Highway Patrol.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>Final Hit: Could Drivers Under 21 Lose Their License If Caught With Marijuana?</h2>
<p>There are potentially severe implications for underage drivers. Despite this, the bill will take exception to medical marijuana patients.</p>
<p>Provided they have the necessary documents to prove&#160;they use the plant for strictly medical conditions. Still, testing those without one still remains in the premature stages of development.</p>
<p>The bill expects officers to perform either an <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/mouth-swab-drug-test/">oral swab saliva test</a> or another chemical field test, but no such form of testing has proven to accurately test for cannabis, especially considering the fact that THC can remain in a regular smoker&#8217;s system for over a month.</p>
<p>It even shows up in <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/long-thc-stay-urine/">urine tests</a>.&#160; According to some of Hill&#8217;s aides, there are currently prototype devices being used in some California jurisdictions under limited use.</p>
<p><a href="https://hightimes.com/news/michigan-police-begin-testing-drivers-saliva-drugs/">Michigan has also undergone a pilot program to test drivers saliva for a variety of drugs</a>, including&#160;amphetamine, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methamphetamine, opiates and cannabis.</p>

<p>DENVER (<em>AP</em>) &#8212; Officials in Colorado&#8217;s largest city on Monday approved Denver&#8217;s first legal marijuana club and joined a small number of business across the country allowing people to consume in states where adult use has been broadly legalized.</p>
<p>Denver voters in 2016 approved a ballot measure allowing so-called &#8220;social consumption&#8221; locations. It took nine months for the city began accepting applications, and industry advocates complained that state restrictions preventing marijuana use at any business with a liquor license and the city&#8217;s own rules made it difficult to find an acceptable location.</p>
<p>For instance, clubs can&#8217;t be located within 1000 feet of a school, day cares or addiction treatment facilities.</p>
<p>Owners of the Coffee Joint were first out of the gate in December. They plan to charge an entry fee to the bring-your-own space where people can vape or consume edible pot products. The business won&#8217;t allow smoking and can&#8217;t sell any marijuana products according to the ballot measure.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not clear when the business will open for consuming customers. Several city departments have to do inspections before the business formally receives its license. Co-owner Rita Tsalyuk said Monday that she hopes to begin operating in two weeks.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Tsalyuk said she has to hire and train more employees. While the space has been open to the public since January, they have only been able to sell pre-packaged coffee, tea and candy or snacks.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel a lot of responsibility,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m very proud of it. I want to take it to a different level and give back to our community as much as we can.&#8221;</p>
<p>Colorado&#8217;s state law doesn&#8217;t address pot clubs. In some cities, they operate openly and are tolerated, while others operate secretly.</p>
<p>Other states with legal marijuana have discussed rules governing places to consume products, but only California appears to have a handful of locations approved by local governments. Alaska regulators have delayed discussion of use in retail shops until spring and officials in Massachusetts balked at recent discussion of statewide regulations for &#8220;cannabis cafes.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Coffee Joint is in an industrial area southwest of downtown Denver, right next door to a marijuana store owned by Tsalyuk&#8217;s husband and the other co-owner of the coffee shop, Kirill Merkulov.</p>
<p>Tsalyuk has said customers often asked employees of the dispensary for advice about where to legally use the products. Most hotels and rental properties ban marijuana use and Colorado doesn&#8217;t permit it in public, including outdoors.</p>

<h4>Red Sparrow (2018)</h4>
<p><em>Red Sparrow</em> is a spy thriller that falls a bit flat. Adapted from the novel of the same name, written by ex-CIA operative Jason Mathews, the film was&#8230;a bit underwhelming. Its only saving grace is the acting. Directed by Francis Lawrence, director of the <em>Hunger Games</em> franchise, <em>Red Sparrow </em>takes viewers on a journey of <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/cannabis-threesome-dos-donts-must-haves-sexy-safe-mind-blowing-experience/" data-wpel-link="internal">seduction</a> and manipulation.</p>

<p>Bolshoi ballerina Dominika Egorova, played beautifully by Jennifer Lawrence, suffers a career-derailing injury early in the film. Egorova&#8217;s corrupt politician uncle, played by Matthias Schoenaerts, plunges her into a world of deceit and manipulation, coercing Dominika into entering Sparrow School. It is here that she learns to use her body and <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/sensory-deprivation/" data-wpel-link="internal">mind</a> as the ultimate weapon by a no-BS matron played by Charlotte Rampling. Rampling plays the role impeccably. She is a force not to be messed with, and, despite her personal objections, graduates Dominika from spy school.</p>
<p>Newly graduated, it becomes Dominika&#8217;s mission to uncover a mole within Russian intelligence. She travels to Budapest, where she meets CIA Agent Nathaniel Nash (yes, Nate Nash), who spends the rest of the film trying to convert the former ballerina into a mole for the Americans. Maybe they even fall for one another&#8212;it&#8217;s hard to tell.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone " src="https://media.giphy.com/media/5KkjN5IuDZG8w/giphy.gif" width="701" height="395"></p>
<p>The movie gives viewers the typical twists and turns of a plot centered around <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/throwback-thursday-pentagon-papers/" data-wpel-link="internal">espionage</a>. Filled with lackluster sex, as well as disturbing sexual violence and torture scenes, <em>Red Sparrow</em> may leave viewers with something more to be desired.</p>
<p>On a scale of 1 to 5&#8212;1 being oregano, and 5 being top-shelf kush, we give <em>Red Sparrow </em>a tepid 2. The film isn&#8217;t abysmal, just a bit clich&#233;. If you like any of the actors, see it; if not, skip this one and watch a better thriller&#8212;there are plenty out there.</p>

<p>The whole incident only took 55 seconds but it still meant&#160;<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2018/01/30/fire-department-investigating-potential-fire-dia-security-line/">waiting travelers had to evacuate</a>&#160;and wait for other security lines to open, the report said.</p>

<p>If you thought our weed laws were <a href="https://hightimes.com/culture/civil-rights-lose-using-legal-marijuana/">strict</a>, think again. Though North America is <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/recreational-marijuana-canada-delayed/">far from perfect</a> when it comes to <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a> policy, by comparison, much of the world is medieval when it comes to drug enforcement. We&#8217;ve listed the countries with the strictest weed laws so you know the punishments for everything. From taking to a toke to running a cannabis empire.</p>
<h2>1. United Arab Emirates</h2>

<p>Drug possession is no joke in the United Arab Emirates. Even carrying residual amounts of any drug, including marijuana, can land you four years in prison, which is the <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/british-columbia-high-court-deals-blow-mandatory-minimums/">minimum jail sentence</a>.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re caught trafficking drugs in the United Arab Emirates, you&#8217;re looking at the death penalty. And yes, having detectable levels of any drug in your bloodstream counts as drug possession.</p>
<p>Make sure you&#8217;re aware of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/united-arab-emirates/local-laws-and-customs" rel="nofollow">customs and laws</a> before traveling to the Emirates, one of the countries with the strictest weed laws.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>Luckily, most people traveling to the Emirates aren&#8217;t going for marijuana tourism. Most often, this country&#8217;s strict drug laws become a problem for people passing through the airport.</p>
<p>Airport security is intense, <a href="http://gulfnews.com/news/uae/crime/smart-device-to-catch-drug-smugglers-in-dubai-1.1504092" rel="nofollow">high-tech</a> and geared towards detecting trace amounts of marijuana. Authorities often pull travelers aside for random drug testing, so better to be safe than sorry.</p>

(AP) &#8212; The general manager grabbing headlines for opening the city&#8217;s social club where members can smoke &#8220;anything that&#8217;s legal in Massachusetts&#8221; hasn&#8217;t ruled out opening new chapters in places Fitchburg or Leominster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every possible option is on the table,&#8221; said Kyle Moon, 27, of Northbridge. &#8220;It&#8217;s a high population area, and it&#8217;s up and coming, just like most of our state.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe even Lowell?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a whirlwind week following the Feb. 9 opening of members-only, The Summit Lounge. On Friday morning, Moon pulled to up to his Water Street establishment amid a row of delis, bars and a hookah lounge.</p>
<p>The business administration student tries a couple different keys before finding one that unlocks the front door to the club for another reporter assigned to see the space an aggravated city manager last week said &#8220;exploited a loophole&#8221; in order to open.</p>
<p>Inside the lounge welcome to members who pay the $50 monthly membership fee large crystal ashtrays sit on shellacked butcher-block tables. Airy blue paintings hang on mahogany walls, and more than one plant is perched near a window.</p>
<p>Standing across from a glass case filled with glass pipes, bowls, candy and chips, Moon said he strives to be transparent, with members of the media, and with the city, which finds itself host to the self-described inaugural club explicitly catering to cannabis connoisseurs in the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;We say that we&#8217;re the first one in Massachusetts, but I know of other underground ones but it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m not sure of their legal status and they haven&#8217;t come out yet so I&#8217;m not gonna, you know what I mean?&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The Summit Club&#8217;s board is comprised of Moon, his siblings and his parents. It was conceived after his brother, a medical marijuana patient, glimpsed a more mature canna-business scene at a trade show in Colorado.</p>
<p>Upon returning to Massachusetts Moon and his ilk sat at a restaurant and tossed around ideas for making their own industry entrance. <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/12/18/massachusetts-cannabis-regulators-busy-rolling-rules-legal-cannabis/94839/">Draft regulations released by the Cannabis Control Commission</a> pegged the cost of recreational retail and distribution licenses at over $10,000 said Moon, but social clubs are locally licensed at a much more modest cost.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a huge monetary investment with growing and distributing, and that&#8217;s not something that the average working family can get into,&#8221; he said beyond the front door, where a black sign advises members and their paid guests of a no-weapons policy, and inside where a no-photography rule is enforced.</p>
<p>While the recreational marijuana industry awaits its marching orders from the CCC, Moon and his family have carved out a niche in the existing legal landscape. Current state law prohibits the sale of recreational marijuana but allows anyone of imbibing age to possess a small amount on their person.</p>

<hr>
<p>Private social clubs like Moon&#8217;s fall outside the scope of regulation by the Cannabis Control Commission, according to spokeswoman Dot Joyce.</p>
<p>&#8220;We only have jurisdiction over the things that we license, and we don&#8217;t license that kind of establishment,&#8221; she said Thursday.</p>
<p>Last week, Worcester City Manager Edward M. Augustus called on the CCC to change that, saying in a statement that &#8220;(The Summit Lounge) did not disclose to the city that he would be operating a private club for the purpose of marijuana consumption. He has exploited a loophole in the 2017 Marijuana Act as well as the draft regulations &#8230; private &#8216;bring your own marijuana&#8217; clubs must be addressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moon said he and his board were transparent in their intentions while submitting license applications for the Summit Lounge.</p>
<p>&#8220;They asked us what are our members going to be smoking and we said, anything that&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2016/11/08/massachusetts-recreational-marijuana-results-question-4-election-2016/66811/">legal in Massachusetts</a>. Then we also had other conversations with the city that went more into more detail,&#8221; Moon said, sitting on bar stool in the back room of the Summit Lounge. &#8220;Even if we didn&#8217;t disclose that they were going to be smoking cannabis&#8230; would the licensing process be any different? No, it wouldn&#8217;t have been because there&#8217;s no differentiation between what&#8217;s legal and what&#8217;s not legal.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said he met with Augustus this week, and all agreed to &#8220;move past this&#8221; and work in concert.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have worked with (the city) and continue to work with them and look forward to working with them, they have concerns, and obviously I have concerns too,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We&#8217;re a new business, they understand we&#8217;re a new business, and they don&#8217;t want to turn small businesses away, but we understand that there are concerns that need to be addressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Moon works a second job as a recovery coach. He is in abstinence-based recovery with four years of sobriety under his belt. He admits to being skeptical to the venture &#8220;when it was pitched to me,&#8221; but was swayed by research he found showing marijuana&#8217;s benefits to people with substance-use disorders or who suffer from chronic pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was one of those things where my own misgivings were kind of confronted and I was able to look at it from an honest standpoint where, just because I don&#8217;t smoke weed, because I don&#8217;t consume cannabis, doesn&#8217;t mean it doesn&#8217;t help a lot of people. I think that&#8217;s where we need to start going as a society,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Moon said The Summit Lounge is a place where medical patients and recreational smokers can meet with &#8220;like minded people.&#8221; He hopes the stigma surrounding cannabis use will fade as more marijuana ventures open up in the state.</p>
<p>And if all goes according to plan, Moon and his family will be part of the wave of businesses that come to the commonwealth after July 1.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do we have ambitions to become a dispensary? It&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s where the money&#8217;s at,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;That is one thing that we&#8217;re working through, we&#8217;re membership driven, so I don&#8217;t know if this location would be a good venture, but we&#8217;re trying to keep everything on the table.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Quinsigamond Community College student said he has been fielding phone calls from people who are interested in opening social clubs like the Summit Lounge in other parts of the state. He considers working with them to open chapters of the social club in several cities.</p>
<p>But for now, Moon is still ironing out wrinkles at his Water Street location &#8212; his point-of-sale system went down last week, and the board is still wrestling with the price structure of membership.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we were opening this we were like, &#8216;we&#8217;re going to have them all over the state, this is gonna be great.&#8217; And then you start to miss a lot of the finer details of just opening the first one, so we&#8217;re focused getting this profitable, or not even profitable but sustainable, and then scaling from there,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>The high court issued the ruling Thursday that said privacy issues outweigh the state&#8217;s interest in pursuing evidence. The case involves Hi Ta Lar, who was a passenger in a vehicle stopped for a broken headlight in 2015.</p>
<p>After finding marijuana and paraphernalia in the vehicle, police ordered Lar to provide a urine sample without consent or a search warrant. The urine sample tested positive for methamphetamine. He was arrested, charged with ingestion and eventually sentenced to three years in prison.</p>

<p>Lar appealed, raising the issue of whether law enforcement can demand a warrantless urine sample as a search incident to arrest, the Argus Leader reported.</p>
<p>According to a 1969 decision in Chimel v. California, an officer can search a person when an arrest is made for any weapons that would harm the officer or help the arrestee escape. Officers also can search the individual for evidence that could be tampered with or destroyed.</p>
<p>This week, the high court ruled in favor of privacy concerns over the state&#8217;s interest in preserving evidence.</p>
<p>&#8220;Although requiring an arrestee to urinate into a specimen container does not involve a physical intrusion into the body, such a search is both more informative and more embarrassing than the breath test,&#8221; the ruling stated.</p>

											    	<h4>The Silence of Thunder</h4>
<p>Isolation can make you go loco. Especially when it&#8217;s forced. Yet isolation can create sanity as well. Cure you of your over-consumptive ills and other maladies. So, how does one <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/sensory-deprivation/" data-wpel-link="internal">construct silence</a> that heals? How do you free yourself of the constant racket ricocheting inside you? How do you set in motion the Silence of Thunder?</p>
<h4>My Canine Zen Monk</h4>
<p>I watched my friend Haggis vanish through the pine forest. Mon Cul nudged my body, let out a whimper. We were now alone, man and dog, best friends from different evolutionary trees, planted side by side, but still I felt we were similar. Sometimes I felt canine, and I know he felt human at times. I was glad he was there sharing this new adventure with me. He was <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/paw-puddy-dog-treats/" data-wpel-link="internal">a good dog</a> and a quiet dog. He would not intrude on the silence, bark needlessly or cause a ruckus. If ever there was a monk he was one, a canine Zen monk. I would learn many lessons from him.</p>

<h4>Shedding Fear</h4>
<p>I sat for a moment in the sunset, leaning against the sunny side of the boulder, took a deep breath, exhaled and listened to the forest <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/exploring-energy-vortices/" data-wpel-link="internal">soughing to itself</a>, boughs shivering in the breezes; birds talking bird-language back and forth to each other, foreign yet not foreign; rock-falls; the tumble and crickle of the stream; the smell of pine resin, acrid and pungent, permeating the carpet of air around me. I found myself in a place between all these gentle noises and the fragrances of the forest. The fear of being alone began to slowly fall away. I relaxed and dropped my shoulders. Still, I wondered if I could make it out there alone for three or four months. Would I miss the tumult of civilization, the conversation of my friends, the wiles and the ways of the world?</p>
<h4>Calling in Well</h4>
<p>Most of us talk about getting away from it all. The way we do it is to take time off from our jobs for a week, for a few days. Maybe if we&#8217;re lucky we get away for two or three weeks. Maybe a month. But usually we go from one noisy place to another, towing the trappings of our material life to make it even noisier. Or we call out sick for a day, trying to nurse the din and clamor out of our minds and bodies. Few of us call out well. That&#8217;s what I was doing. <a href="http://www.signature-reads.com/2013/07/its-national-call-in-well-day-in-honor-of-counter-culture-king-tom-robbins/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Calling in well</a>, thank you very much. Rebirth, that&#8217;s what I was after. A new lease on my life. The phoenix rising out of the ashes. I wanted some inkling of a beginning where the silence would cradle me in its arms. I think if you want, you construct silence a little at a time over the course of your life. That&#8217;s what I was after and, since my life had always been so noisy, to say the least, this seemed like the place to begin. To carve out time and quiet for myself. In the wild, high above Boulder.</p>
<h4><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34571" src="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Phoenix-Rising.jpg" alt="" width="1625" height="833" srcset="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Phoenix-Rising.jpg 1625w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Phoenix-Rising-768x394.jpg 768w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Phoenix-Rising-1024x525.jpg 1024w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Phoenix-Rising-770x395.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1625px) 100vw, 1625px"></h4>
<h4>My New Home</h4>
<p>The material baggage of my former life lay on the ground in front of the boulder that was to be my home for the next three or four months&#8212;that is, if the rangers didn&#8217;t come and haul me away. Tonight, I&#8217;d build a small fire and sleep next to it. In the morning I&#8217;d start work on my boulder to <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/pamela-bosch-house-hemp/" data-wpel-link="internal">construct a living space</a> underneath the massive overhang. I didn&#8217;t want to make it my own. I wanted to be one with it, respect the space, so that when I left it would look exactly as I had found it.</p>
<h4>My First Hit in the Wild</h4>
<p>I gathered firewood and soon had a small fire leaping into the night. It was getting cold, the sun had gone down. The sky was black and bright, fire embers rising to mingle with the stars. I wrapped my sleeping bag around me, lit a joint and sat back against a rock. Mon Cul snuggled next to me and let out a long groan. At first, the silence, except for the crackling fire, seemed to scream in my ears. But as I relaxed, all sound dissipated and the quiet of my environs enveloped me. With every drag of the pot, I seemed to melt into the landscape and become one with it. I fell asleep in that position and woke the next morning sprawled on the ground with Mon Cul nestled against my back. There was a blanket piled over the sleeping bag. I didn&#8217;t remember putting it on. Had a Wood Sprite come in the dead of night to look over me?</p>

<h4>Boulder Building Blocks</h4>
<p>I built a frame out of the two by fours and covered it in the plastic I had bought, stapling it into place. I leaned the frame up under the overhang, securing it snuggling against the rock. &#160;I fixed the bottom of the frame into the soil, put large rocks up against it to keep it from shifting in the wind. There was no door, just an opening to one side where I hung a sheet of plastic. Through this portal, I ferried my stuff inside. I lay some boughs in one corner for my bed. I placed my sleeping bag and some blankets on my new bed to keep me warm. In the coming days I built a table out of timber fell. I placed my kitchen utensils and supplies in nooks and crannies of the boulder. I had brought along a gas stove so I could cook my rice and beans without building a fire every night. I had an old threadbare rug, which I spread out. <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/kent-state-shootings/" data-wpel-link="internal">My abode</a> away from the bustle was nearly complete.</p>
<h4>Orange Sunshine in the Sun of Silence</h4>
<p>Every other day I bathed in a pool in the stream. I used <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/one-none-david-bronners-legacy-activism/" data-wpel-link="internal">Dr. Bronner&#8217;s</a> mentholated soap, which was biodegradable. I dug a latrine, took long walks into the hills with Mon Cul, who was always at my side. I found a flat rock not far from my boulder. Here, I sat with my books and read in the sun. Here, I meditated. Here I dropped acid one morning. Silence overcame me and I never felt so good. I was wrapped in it like a blanket. Usually acid made me see bright wavering colors and unusual shapes&#8212;it had a noise all its own, intruding on me. I had always dropped it with others, never alone. This time, I was alone and it made a difference. The silence wasn&#8217;t deafening, it didn&#8217;t talk to me. It was&#8230;just&#8212;there. A blanket, warm, inviting; a presence, if you will.</p>

<h4>Live Your Life</h4>
<p>Most of us are afraid of silence. Maybe because it&#8217;s what we think death will be like. Death is silence, no doubt. We think to be alone without the company of another human is something to fear. No relationships. Maybe you feel inadequate, or not good enough to be with others. Or even with yourself. It&#8217;s good to feel comfortable with yourself. true silence of the self is jettisoning the self. Live your life.</p>
<h4>Planting the Pot Plants</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/high-country-healing-colorado/" data-wpel-link="internal">I planted the pot plants</a> on the tenth day. I thought long and hard about where to put them, looking at various locations like a movie scout. I found a sunny spot near the stream. The soil was rocky and sandy, but moist from the spring rains. I carefully removed the ten seedlings Haggis had given me and laid them on the ground. I spaced them about three feet apart, dug holes with my spade and planted them, watered them and got ready to watch them flourish in the silence of thunder. It was a most satisfying moment in isolation.</p>

<p>With action by the town council in Baton Rouge, this city just loosened penalties for <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a> charges. On&#160; February 28, the East Baton Rouge Town Council voted to reduce the penalties for cannabis possession. The new provisions would go into effect 30 days after a signature from Mayor-President Sharon Weston Broome.</p>
<h2>Broome Responds To Measure</h2>
<p>Broome has responded positively to the measure. She said she plans to &#8220;extensively review&#8221; the law with the parish attorney, according to <a href="http://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/article_9d76b760-1cd7-11e8-9366-ff481253aa72.html" rel="nofollow">reports in local media</a>. Broome added that she had &#8220;no plans to veto&#8221; the law.</p>
<p>Broome also said the new provisions will allow police to focus on more serious crimes. Local law enforcement supports the ordinance.</p>
<p>&#8220;My position aligns with BRPD and Chief Murphy Paul. This ordinance will allow us to rededicate resources to felony offenders. It also attaches penalties to possession without the stigma of prison,&#8221; said Broome.</p>
<p>She also mentioned the new law would align with the policy already in effect. &#8220;Our current practice is to issue summonses for simple possession of marijuana, and this new ordinance will not change that.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Under the new provisions of the city&#8217;s marijuana ordinance, possession of less than 14 grams of marijuana would be punished by a fine instead of jail time.</p>
<p>Police officers would also issue citations instead of arresting offenders and taking them to jail. Fourteen grams is equivalent to about half an ounce.</p>
<h2>Fines Instead of Jail</h2>
<p>A person convicted of possession&#160;of fewer than 14 grams would be required to pay a fine of $40. The fine for a second offense would be $60. A three-time offender would have to pay $80.</p>
<p>Fines for fourth and subsequent violations would be $100. The new rules are similar to those adopted by the City of New Orleans in 2016.</p>
<p>Many residents of Baton Rouge attended the town council meeting. Most supported the measure. Others thought it didn&#8217;t go far enough, and advocated for the full legalization of marijuana.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>Jacob Irving is a law student at LSU and a cannabis activist. He has been working to reform cannabis laws at the state level, as well. He told the council that the measure is a better use of community resources.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want one of my tax dollars to be spent incarcerating someone for marijuana,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>Addressing Racial Inequalities</h2>
<p>Councilman LaMont Cole is one of the sponsors of the new ordinance. He said enforcement of cannabis laws has &#8220;destroyed our community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cole said that the <a href="https://hightimes.com/culture/rick-steves-pot-prohibition-hurts-poor-people-of-color/">war on drugs has sent people of color to prison for using marijuana</a>. Once there, they are forced to live with hardened criminals and violent felons.</p>
<p>However, Cole was careful to point out that the new provisions are not pro-cannabis.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if I would use the language &#8216;let people smoke weed,&#8217; but I would say &#8216;let&#8217;s not send people to prison,''&#8221; he said.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>Final Hit:&#160;This City Just Loosened Penalties For Marijuana Charges</h2>
<p>But not all of the council was on board with the measure. Councilman Trae Welch, who voted against the ordinance, said the law would send mixed signals to youth and jeopardize their safety.</p>
<p>&#8220;Until there&#8217;s a safe place to buy drugs, why are we sending kids to drug dealers and saying it&#8217;s ok?&#8221; asked Welch.</p>
<p>The town council passed the measure by a vote of 8-4. However, Mayor-President Broome has yet to sign off on the new provisions.</p>

<p>When Vermont Governor Phil Scott (Rep.) signed House Bill 511 to legalize recreational <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> on January 22,&#160; he spoke very clearly about users&#8217; right to privacy. &#8220;I personally believe that what adults do behind closed doors and on private property is their choice, so long as it does not negatively impact the health and safety of others, especially children,&#8221; Gov. Scott wrote in a press release after the signing. But some law enforcement officials are calling for an officious crackdown on the odors wafting under the closed doors of people using or growing cannabis in their own homes. And now with the support of Republican lawmakers in the state, Vermont considers a measure to regulate cannabis smell.</p>
<h2>Vermont Considers A Measure To Regulate Cannabis Smell</h2>
<p>Vermont legalized recreational cannabis <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/vermont-legalized-weed/">through a legislative process</a>, making it the only legal-weed state to do so. Rather than a ballot referendum for voters to decide yes or no, lawmakers voted on a bi-partisan bill.</p>
<p>The bill Gov. Scott signed into law in late January is both similar and different from cannabis legislation in other states. The law allows adults 21 and over to personally possess an ounce of flower and five grams of <a href="https://hightimes.com/dabs/future-holds-concentrates/">concentrate</a>. Adults can also cultivate two mature and four immature plants in their home. And like other legal weed states, Vermont has prohibited the public consumption of cannabis. The law will take effect in July this year.</p>
<p>However, the law did not establish any rules for a legal cannabis market in the state. And without a commercial cultivation or retail program in place, legal cannabis in Vermont is virtually an entirely &#8220;behind-closed-doors&#8221; operation by default.</p>
<p>But now, as Vermont considers a measure to regulate <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/the-genes-of-terpenes-scientists-discover-pots-smell-predictor/">cannabis smell</a>, law enforcement is looking to control how people consume weed on their private property.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">

		</div>

<p>The bill currently under consideration in the Vermont House of Representatives would grant cities the right to classify the odor of cannabis as a &#8220;public nuisance&#8221;. In Vermont, a <a href="https://legislature.vermont.gov/statutes/section/24/061/02291" rel="nofollow">public nuisance</a> is a ticketable offense.</p>
<p>So if someone in the neighborhood decides they&#8217;ve <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/court-neighbors-can-sue-pot-growers-for-stinky-smells/">had enough of the smell</a> of cannabis, they would be able to notify authorities, who would have the power to issue a citation.</p>
<h2>Bill To Regulate Cannabis Smell Likely To Pass House</h2>
<p>The bill will come to a vote by the House Committee on Government Operations on Friday. The bill has the support of the Republican legislators on Gov. Scott&#8217;s cannabis commission. The governor&#8217;s commission does not include any <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/cannabidiol-cbd/">caregivers</a>, patients, or cannabis industry representatives. Democratic lawmakers who support legal cannabis, like Dem. Rep. Cindy Weed, think the move is premature.</p>
<p>If the Vermont House passes the measure, it will <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/vermont/articles/2018-03-02/lawmakers-propose-bill-limiting-marijuana-odor" rel="nofollow">go into effect July 2, 2018</a>, according to the AP.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, one of the reasons for legalizing adult cannabis use in Vermont was to <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/vermont-governor-pardons-hundreds-of-pot-convictions/">free up law enforcement resources</a> to focus on more serious crimes. Yet law enforcement officials are the people behind the push to classify the smell of weed as a public nuisance.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>&#8220;I feel, as a non-marijuana user, that I should not have somebody else&#8217;s use impact my life,&#8221; South Burlington Police Chief Trevor Whipple <a href="https://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/government/2018/03/01/vt-bill-would-empower-towns-limit-marijuana-odor/373104002/" rel="nofollow">told</a> the <em>Burlington Free Press</em>.</p>
<p>Whipple spoke in favor of the bill on Thursday at the House Committee on Government Operations. He also acknowledged that his department has never received a complaint about cannabis odor. Vermont has had legal medical cannabis since 2004.</p>
<p>Another chief of police, Chief Tim Page of St. Johnsbury, spoke in favor of the bill but acknowledged the importance of respecting the right to use cannabis.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t want it to be so overly restrictive that it denies the person their right of use,&#8221; Page said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Critics of the move, like director of the Vermont Apartment Owners Association Angela Zaikowski, worry landlords could receive fines for tenants using cannabis. Landlords already have the right to restrict tenants from growing or consuming marijuana under the current law. Concerns over fines may prompt many landlords to more actively restrict their tenants&#8217; cannabis use and cultivation.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>Final Hit: Vermont Considers A Measure To Regulate Cannabis Smell</h2>
<p>Nevertheless, with a broad base of support, the bill regulating <a href="https://hightimes.com/culture/incense-scented-candles/">marijuana smell</a> is likely to pass. But it seems to be the case that lawmakers are trying to solve a problem that doesn&#8217;t exist. Or at least, not yet. But it would re-commit law enforcement resources to handling ultra-petty cannabis violations.</p>

					<p>Jewish tradition suggests one should celebrate Purim by getting so drunk that they cannot tell the difference between Mordechai and Haman. <span id="more-69789"></span>But if you&#8217;re looking for a different kind of heavenly high this Purim, why not try a batch of cannabis-infused hempanteshen?</p>
<p>Selling marijuana edibles will not initially be allowed when cannabis is legalized this summer. But there will be nothing to stop people from making their own mind-altering culinary creations at home.</p>
<p>Eating cannabis is great for people who want the psychotropic effects, or medical benefits, of marijuana, without inhaling smoke (insert Bill Clinton joke here), but it is not as simple as throwing some dry herb into your favourite dish.</p>

											    	<p>Feel like throwing your phone in the toilet? Social media driving you nuts with its constant red vs. blue ideological gridlock narrative? Well, don&#8217;t throw that phone just yet. There are still politics that deserve your attention.</p>
<p>Sure, there are many things the White House controls that affect your day-to-day life. Federal taxes, healthcare policy, the red button that shoots the nukes. Besides the threat of all-out nuclear war, it may be possible we give the federal branch of government too much attention in other arenas. A resident of the United States is governed by laws from at least three different levels of government: federal, state and local. And it&#8217;s at the local level that voters pay the least attention, despite this level of government being responsible for the majority of services they use.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34598" src="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Government.jpg" alt="Vox Populi: Focus on Local Politics, Not Trump" width="1625" height="833" srcset="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Government.jpg 1625w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Government-768x394.jpg 768w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Government-1024x525.jpg 1024w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Government-770x395.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1625px) 100vw, 1625px"></p>
<p>Cannabis consumers have a keen understanding of how the different branches of government exercise their power; we consume a federally illegal substance because your state government has chosen to permit medical or recreational marijuana, and your county has decided to permit marijuana to be dispensed. Of course, maintaining this structure relies upon the federal government to not pursue states for breaking federal law, as is the case currently.</p>
<h4>Democracy</h4>
<p>The responsibility for administering our elections falls to local government. Is there a more important responsibility in government? Free and fair elections are the basis of democracy, and local government gets it done.</p>
<h4>Zoning</h4>
<p>The only thing stopping a shopping mall from popping up next to your house is zoning laws. But who makes these laws, who has the power to change them, and why would they? Through zoning laws, counties and cities control how they grow and make themselves fit to compete in the future. Or, as in the case of our cities shrinking on the tail end of a boom, local government may decide to turn once-residential areas into greenspace.</p>
<h4>Education</h4>
<p>Do you know people who move to get into a better school district? That&#8217;s because your neighboring local government is likely doing a better job than yours, and the power of having the right people in power. According to National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), 44.8 percent of national total revenue for the 2012 school year was received from local government.</p>
<h4>Transport</h4>
<p>This is where local government is most keenly felt. What are the conditions of the roads in your area? What are your transport options? According to the National Association of Counties (NAOC), &#8220;By providing efficient transportation and transit options such as buses, trains, light rail and subway systems, counties are the driving force connecting communities.&#8221; Counties own and maintain 45 percent of America&#8217;s roads.</p>
<h4>Health</h4>
<p>We&#8217;re always hearing about the healthcare debate in Washington. Whatever side of the aisle you stand on, regardless, it&#8217;s your local government who is charged with delivering those services. And though some counties are large and some small, dollars spent on health quickly stack up; NAOC concluded that counties spend nearly $70 billion dollars a year on community health and hospitals.</p>
<h4>Tax</h4>
<p>Homeowners will be all too familiar with property taxes. Along with sales tax, property taxes are the primary way counties raise tax revenue.</p>
<h4>Law enforcement</h4>
<p>Counties are crucial in maintaining safe communities, as they operate 911 emergency systems and spend about $28 billion on law enforcement annually. There are 3,105 county sheriff and police departments nationwide, and 2,914 counties own a jail or participate in a regional jail. In most cases, county-level police and firefighters respond to crimes and disasters without assistance from other levels of government.</p>
<h4>Weed</h4>
<p>Ever lived in a city that doesn&#8217;t have dispensaries, yet in the next town over budtenders outnumber bartenders? This is the result of a city ordinance. It&#8217;s a resident&#8217;s right to decide what businesses can operate in your area, and if you want a dispensary and don&#8217;t currently have one, you need to reach out to a local representative.</p>
<p>It is, of course, the state government that permits medical marijuana. Once the right to access medical marijuana is won, the administration of the system falls to the level of government below: local. There are always local solutions to respect the wishes of local people. When California first permitted medical marijuana, Emerald Triangle counties permitted more plants to be grown &#160;than anywhere else, honoring the area&#8217;s agricultural past&#8212;and planning for its future.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34599" src="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wertsg.jpg" alt="Vox Populi: Focus on Local Politics, Not Trump" width="1625" height="833" srcset="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wertsg.jpg 1625w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wertsg-768x394.jpg 768w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wertsg-1024x525.jpg 1024w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/wertsg-770x395.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1625px) 100vw, 1625px"></p>
<p>The decisions made at your local government level (especially county) have very tangible effects on your day-to-day life. And you can visit these people! I can&#8217;t guarantee you an audience, but you have a better chance of speaking with someone at county hall than at the White House. More importantly, a county commissioner will know your area, and likely already be aware of your issue(s). These are the politics that matter to your everyday life. This isn&#8217;t ideological; it&#8217;s daily, sometimes dull and specific to constituents. Is it time to switch off Washington entirely? Of course not. But it might be time to focus on another arena that matters just as much.</p>
<h4>STATS</h4>
<p>No two counties are alike. From biggest to smallest, one facet of America&#8217;s diversity can be seen in how disparate its counties are. Here&#8217;s a look at how they shaped up as of 2016, according to Wikipedia:</p>
<h5>#1</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>12 square miles:</strong> Size of the smallest county in the U.S., Kalawao County, Hawaii</li>
<li><strong>20,057 square miles:</strong> Size of the largest county in the U.S., San Bernardino County, California</li>
</ul>
<h5>#2</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>88:</strong> Number of residents in Kalawao County</li>
<li><strong>10,137,915:</strong> Number of residents in Los Angeles</li>
</ul>
<h5>#3</h5>
<ul>
<li><strong>69,468:</strong> Residents per square mile in New York City (Manhattan), making it the most densely populated country in the U.S.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Keep It Local</h4>
<p>It may not be glamorous, but local governments make our daily lives run smoothly&#8212;and citizens rarely think about what they do. According to the National Association of Counties, there are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>38,968:</strong> Elected county officials</li>
<li><strong>$482.1 billion:</strong> Dollars spent</li>
<li><strong>3 million:</strong> People employed</li>
<li><strong>305 million:</strong> County residents served</li>
</ul>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rep. Roe&#8217;s message was directly aimed at <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2018/01/16/va-says-it-wont-study-medical-marijuanas-effect-on-veterans/?utm_term=.91e789f1e5e8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VA Secretary David Shulkin</a>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shulkin has often claimed the VA is prohibited by federal law from conducting research on medicinal cannabis, or even recommending it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a Dec. 2017 </span><a href="https://walz.house.gov/sites/walz.house.gov/files/VA-Response-to-Oct-26-Letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">letter</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to Minnesota Congressman Tim Walz, Shulkin noted the &#8220;VA is committed to research and developing effective ways to help veterans cope with post-traumatic stress disorder and chronic pain conditions.&#8221; Shulkin then explained that &#8220;federal law restricts VA&#8217;s ability to conduct research involving medical marijuana, or to refer veterans to such research projects.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The VA modified its information on their </span><a href="https://www.research.va.gov/topics/ptsd.cfm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">PTSD overview page</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in February.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After first acknowledging their review of existing literature discovered &#8220;limited evidence&#8221; that cannabis could alleviate neuropathic pain for some vets, the VA concluded the department &#8220;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">is not currently able to prescribe medical marijuana to Veterans, </span><b>but can look at marijuana as an option for treating Veterans</b><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In agreement with Rep.

They&#8217;re around one another nearly twenty-four hours a day, and, other than Christmas, only take four days off a year to go on a cruise. But even on vacation, James admits he checks his emails. &#8220;We work every day,&#8221; says Rosie.</p>
<p><em>Welcome to the life of a cannabusiness couple.</em></p>
<p>Relationships are hard enough&#8212;add forging a business in the ever-changing cannabis industry into the mix and things get a whole lot more interesting. I ask if they ever get on one another&#8217;s nerves. &#8220;We&#8217;re good at separating,&#8221; Rosie laughs, and states that issues with work don&#8217;t arise because they &#8220;have such a strong common goal.&#8221; &#8220;We understand when the other one is staying late,&#8221; James adds.</p>

<p>Even though they&#8217;re workhorses, they institute a &#8220;no devices&#8221; rule at the dinner table. I assumed they also had a &#8220;no shop talk&#8221; policy during dinner, but Rosie declares, &#8220;We actually do some of our best [business] brainstorming during dinner! Without phones or tablets we can <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/cannabis-creative/" data-wpel-link="internal">think better</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>HempStaff travels to 30 cannabis-friendly states across the country to teach their courses, which are mostly focused on dispensary agent training. There are two trainers per class: one is more employment-focused, detailing <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/advice-cannabusiness-success/" data-wpel-link="internal">how to get a job in the industry</a>, while the other trainer explains important cannabis basics&#8212;cultivation techniques, terpenes, cannabinoids, CBD vs. THC and more. Rosie reports that attendees are typically a 70/30 split of men to women in the 35-55 age range, but James notes they&#8217;ve had clients ranging from fresh out of high school to people in their &#8216;70s. Some are doctors and pharmacists, while others have only retail experience. Cannabusiness owners bring their staff to keep them up-to-date on laws and regulations, while medical personnel brush up on the benefits of cannabis missing from their medical school textbooks. About 10% of attendees are medical patients and caregivers who&#8217;d like to learn more about our healing plant.</p>

<p>There are unique challenges to presenting a course on <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/vermont-legalizes-mj/" data-wpel-link="internal">cannabis laws and regulations</a>, given the lack of federal legalization. New laws passed on a Friday mean Monday&#8217;s presentation is now factually incorrect. Rosie recalled the time they published a book that almost immediately became obsolete, emphasizing the importance of all their trainers&#8217; intimate knowledge of the industry in every region of the country.</p>
<p>Rosie teaches a number of classes herself, and at one point was on the road three out of four weekends a month. I asked if the travel put a strain on their relationship, but she and James, unsurprisingly, have a system all worked out. They check in with one another frequently and ensure that the weekend she <em>is</em> home is dedicated to one another. &#8220;James is the rock of the office&#8212;and of the house,&#8221; Rosie professes. He knows how much she enjoys teaching, but does acknowledge it makes doing certain activities they used to enjoy, like going to concerts and festivals, more difficult. &#8220;Neither of us regret anything,&#8221; James happily remarks, noting its simply the tradeoff of owning your own business.</p>

<p>Professionalism is stressed throughout their curriculum. &#8220;It&#8217;s just getting more and more professional as more states get on board [with legalization],&#8221; Rosie emphasizes. &#8220;Gone are the days of &#8216;Oh, this is just a <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/smokin-js-committed-culture/" data-wpel-link="internal">head shop</a>.&#8217; People want to know what they&#8217;re consuming. &#8216;What percentage THC? CBD?&#8217;&#8221; Patients are becoming more educated about cannabis, and budtenders need to keep up.</p>
<p>But HempStaff doesn&#8217;t just teach classes, they also handle recruiting for cannabis jobs. Regarding budtenders, the industry has thankfully evolved: &#8220;People are no longer sending in &#8216;body shot&#8217; photos with their resumes, if you know what I mean,&#8221; Rosie chuckles. &#8220;We&#8217;ve grown up from that. This is a legitimate industry. Gone are the days of spandex and halter top uniforms!&#8221;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a lot of hard work, but it&#8217;s clear the Yagielos love what they do. Owning your own cannabusiness isn&#8217;t easy, nor is becoming business partners with your romantic partner. Put in the work every single day, come up with a plan that works for the two of you, and the sky is the limit!</p>

			<p>The marijuana industry is fighting a high-stakes court battle to force the Israeli government to approve medical cannabis exports sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>The decision by industry advocates to go to court comes as Israeli lawmakers prepare to debate the country&#8217;s medical cannabis export policy on Monday.</p>
<p>The outcome is huge for dozens of international marijuana producers, manufacturers and investors, who have spent millions of dollars to build facilities in Israel to capitalize on the government&#8217;s plans to permit cannabis exports.</p>
<p>Those export plans hit a speed bump earlier this month, however.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cannabisbenchmarks.com/annual-review-and-outlook-2017-2018-edition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-66014" src="https://mjbizdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1.png" alt="" width="300"></a>Monday&#8217;s meeting of lawmakers comes two weeks after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/israel-hits-pause-medical-marijuana-exports-cronos-exec-not-concerned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed reforms</a> that would have paved the way for cannabis growers to send their product abroad.</p>
<p>&#8220;If exports aren&#8217;t approved, cannabis producers in Israel won&#8217;t be able to sustain themselves economically because growing cannabis for only domestic production in Israel isn&#8217;t profitable,&#8221; said Hagit Weinstock, a lawyer representing marijuana cultivators and investors from Israel and overseas.</p>
<p>She has gone to court to order the government to approve exports.</p>
<p>&#8220;It has to be this year,&#8221; she said in an interview. &#8220;We want it approved by April.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Netanyahu seeks review of MMJ policy</strong></p>
<p>The government policy remains up in the air for the time being.</p>
<p>Netanyahu recently instructed the National Economic Council and the Health Ministry to prepare a review of the financial benefits and the security risks of medical cannabis, prompted by concerns that product could find its way into the black market.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s unclear if that review will be completed in time for Monday&#8217;s meeting of lawmakers. The study was expected to take two weeks to complete.</p>
<p>Despite the delay, marijuana industry officials are confident they ultimately will prevail.</p>
<p>Sources told&#160;<em>Marijuana Business Daily </em>it&#8217;s a matter of when, not if, exports ultimately win approval from government authorities.</p>
<p>But the industry isn&#8217;t taking anything for granted.</p>
<p><strong>See you in court</strong></p>
<p>Weinstock, the lawyer,&#160;said she asked the court to impose an April deadline for the government to start approving export licenses.</p>
<p>She said the marijuana industry doesn&#8217;t have time for a long review of the government&#8217;s export policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Producers have all their licenses except one &#8211; an export license,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>After being assured by the Israeli government that exports would be approved this year, MMJ cultivators and manufacturers have already invested millions to build out infrastructure.</p>
<p>Construction is advancing on those facilities while Israeli lawmakers iron out details on exports.</p>
<p>Exports are essential to the producers&#8217; business models because Israel&#8217;s domestic market is too small to warrant the scale of investment needed to produce medical cannabis.</p>
<p>Growing cannabis in the desert &#8211; while adhering to strict international quality standards &#8211; is an expensive proposition.</p>
<p><strong>Staying the course</strong></p>
<p>One Canadian company planning a multimillion-dollar operation in Israel isn&#8217;t altering its plans, wagering that Israel ultimately will permit exports.</p>
<p>Stayner, Ontario-based Cronos Group expanded to Israel <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/canadas-cronos-teams-partner-israel-grow-medical-cannabis-export/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year</a>, announcing it&#160;hopes to generate nearly 200 million Canadian dollars ($160 million). The company said at the time the initial nine-month buildout would cost less than CA$10 million and produce 5,000 kilograms of MMJ annually.</p>
<p>&#8220;Responsible governments think through risks and set up for success,&#8221; CEO Mike Gorenstein said of the delay in Israel&#8217;s export plans.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just like Canadian and Australian regulators, Israelis want to be sure that cannabis is only being exported to federally legal and medicinal markets.</p>
<p>&#8220;These discussions are a standard part of implementing historic and responsible cannabis regulations that allow for patients around the world to get the treatment that they need.&#8221;</p>

<p>The state of Arkansas passed comprehensive medical <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> legalization in 2016, after voters approved Amendment 98.&#160; Over the past year, the state has been rolling out its regulatory policy and reviewing applications from prospective growers and retailers. Already, the Arkansas Department of Health has approved 4,116 applications for patients with qualifying conditions. With registered patients ready, Arkansas will start licensing medical marijuana growers this week. But unusual legal hurdles could pose challenges for the state&#8217;s young medical cannabis program.</p>
<h2>Arkansas Will Start Licensing Medical Marijuana Growers This Week</h2>
<p>Today, the <a href="http://www.mmc.arkansas.gov/" rel="nofollow">Arkansas Medical Marijuana Commission</a> is slated to announce the winners of the first round of applications to <a href="https://hightimes.com/grow/grow-weed-guide-beginners/">grow cannabis</a>. According to reports, the state has approved applications for five growing centers. These groups will be the first to legally grow <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/arkansas-gets-first-medical-pot-dispensary-application/">medical cannabis in Arkansas</a>.</p>
<p>After the initial approval of <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/one-step-closer-growing-weed-mars/">growing operations</a>, the commission will begin reviewing applications for retailers. By May, Arkansas officials expect to have approved over 30 dispensaries, <a href="http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/feb/26/hopefuls-await-license-decision-for-gro/" rel="nofollow">said</a> a spokesperson for the state Department of Finance and Administration.</p>
<p>All of this means that by early summer, qualifying patients will finally be able to <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/arkansas-nears-medical-marijuana-license-deadline/">legally purchase medical marijuana in Arkansas</a>. After a year of debates about implementing the program, growers and retailers are now jockeying for position. But not everyone can make the cut, leading to concerns that rejected applicants could sue the state over its decision.</p>
<h2>Arkansas Expects Legal Challenges From Rejected Growers</h2>
<p>The five growers the state will approve tomorrow represent just <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/no-applications-to-grow-dispense-arkansas-medical-marijuana/">a fraction of the applications</a> submitted to the state. According the Arkansas medical marijuana commissioners, who reviewed 95 applications for growing centers, some applicants just didn&#8217;t make the cut.</p>
<p>But applying for a permit to grow medical cannabis isn&#8217;t cheap, and growers whose applications did not pass muster are looking for a refund. Some are even preparing to sue the state over its decision.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Just submitting an application to become an approved grower costs $15,000 dollars. Growers then have to fork over an extra $100,000 if the Commission accepts their application.</p>
<p>Yet those aren&#8217;t the only costs. Given the complexity and competitiveness of the application process, many applicants hired attorneys and consultants for help.</p>
<p>All told, competitive bidders for grow operations spent between $150,000 and $200,000, according to <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/will-robots-take-cannabis-industry/">industry insiders</a>. These costs represent a significant investment. No wonder losing applicants are preparing to file legal challenges against the commission&#8217;s decision.</p>
<p>This type of litigious response is more common than many may think.&#160; But Arkansas has thrown prospective growers and their lawyers a curveball.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>In <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/4463287/the-board-of-trustees-of-the-university-of-arkansas-v-matthew-andrews/" rel="nofollow">a prior court ruling</a>, the Arkansas Supreme Court reaffirmed the constitutional principle of sovereign immunity. And that means the state and its agencies can&#8217;t be sued in court.</p>
<p>Some appeals from rejected applicants have already been thrown out, though it&#8217;s unclear whether these are linked to the precedent. However, the state still expects some applicants to appeal. Their argument is that the state has not reviewed their application fairly.</p>
<h2>Despite Legal Concerns, Arkansas Will Start Licensing Medical Marijuana Growers This Week</h2>
<p>While some growers may feel frustrated over the competitive application process, many argue the state&#8217;s rules are better for patients. Whatever the Arkansas medical marijuana commission decides, patients can expect.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the state&#8217;s concern is ensuring growers and dispensaries have enough high quality, affordable medical cannabis available.</p>
<p>Furthermore, applicants who withdrew early or failed to meet minimum requirements received a full refund. Applicants who scored outside the top five will receive a refund of half their application cost.</p>

			<p>The NBA is the only Big 4 league to embrace cannabis, even if that acceptance simply means turning a blind eye. It should be no surprise, then, that so many former NBA players have openly embraced cannabis. While it&#8217;s one thing to enjoy getting high or using cannabis medicinally, it&#8217;s another to invest your money in the industry&#8212;not to mention involving your family. Four-time NBA champion, talk show host, husband and father of three, John &#8220;The Spider&#8221; Salley, has done just that. Health and fitness have been the center of John&#8217;s message since before he left the league, publicly proclaiming his vegetarianism in 1999. As John says, &#8220;If you&#8217;re all about plants, and a plant-based diet, then you have to be about cannabis.&#8221; But his new company isn&#8217;t an example of yet another celebrity looking to slap their face on a box. John&#8217;s entrance to the cannabis space has been making waves, but he&#8217;s not going it alone.</p>
<p>Picking someone he knew he could trust, John has partnered with his daughter, Tyla. At twenty one years old, Tyla is the CEO of their joint venture, Deuces, and clearly the head honcho. With only a year under their belt as a company, John and Tyla have managed to draw tremendous attention around their upcoming product line, tirelessly sourcing the best product and running the weekend expo circuit. As a purveyor of fine cannabis, I was eager to meet up with these two to see how Deuces has come together.</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re interviewing a celebrity, there&#8217;s always an underlying nervousness. You really don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;re going to interact, or what their expectations are. And though everyone I&#8217;ve had the opportunity to work with has been nothing but pleasant, we&#8217;ve all heard the stories of the rich and famous. The last thing I needed to do was look bad in front of John Salley. Making Tyla and John feel right at home wasn&#8217;t hard, considering the forewarning we were given for working with John: have lots of food available! It&#8217;s no wonder, seeing as he&#8217;s not just a beast of a man, but a lifelong athlete that his appetite is equally as impressive as his reputation. Following his motto&#8212;&#8220;Eat what elephants eat&#8221;&#8212;the DOPE crew showed up proper with some delicious vegan food: mushroom &#8220;carnitas&#8221; mission burritos, Indian curry bowls with yams and lentils, and, of course, tons of greens. If there&#8217;s one thing we could bond over, it was good food and cannabis.</p>

			<h3>The Early Years</h3>
<p>The &#8220;I started smoking tough when I was 14,&#8221; guy is definitely not John. Raised in Brooklyn, New York, in the seventies, John&#8217;s approach to life&#8212;not just cannabis&#8212;has been all about health. It makes sense, considering his past. He excelled in one of the most athletically-demanding sports for thirty years, and has maintained his fitness to the present day. Believe it or not, though he remembers seeing pot around, John didn&#8217;t even try cannabis until he was 36! After growing up in NYC, excelling through high school sports and later attending Georgia Tech&#8212;where he worked part-time, in addition to being a student athlete&#8212;John didn&#8217;t have much time for extracurricular activities. The NBA (and America at large) in the &#8216;80s and &#8216;90s wasn&#8217;t very friendly to cannabis, so neither was John. The health and wellness kick of the late &#8216;90s, however, was in full-swing, and John was all ears. Thanks to his teammate Adrian Dantley, John began to open his eyes to a new lifestyle, one based around food as fuel.</p>
<p>But basketball wasn&#8217;t John&#8217;s only love. &#8220;I wanted to be a late-night talk show host,&#8221; he shares. &#8220;It was like 1989, it was the All Star Game in Houston, [the show] <em>Inside Stuff</em>, it had just started&#8212;NBA TV was just blowing up. My man Don Sperling said uh, &#8216;Hey!&#8217; and gave me a mic, and I took the camera crew through security. I said, &#8216;They&#8217;re alright,&#8217; as if I [knew what I was doing], and I sat there right before the slam dunk contest . . . So that summer, we win the championship, so of course I grab the mic again, I wanna be in front of the mic. I just knew that was what I was going to do.&#8221; And boy, did he. Before finishing his professional basketball career he had roles in two major Hollywood films, <em>Bad Boys</em> and <em>Eddie, </em>which only further demonstrated his onscreen talents before solidifying his legacy as one of the hosts of Fox&#8217;s <em>The Best Damn Sports Show Period</em>.</p>

			<h3>Interviewing an On-Camera Pro</h3>
<p>&#8220;Quiet on set,&#8221; John declares as we cue that we&#8217;re rolling. The 1908 Loft is a massive space with vaulted ceilings, where even the tapping of fingers against a cell phone can be heard across the room. To those unfamiliar with video production, John&#8217;s intensity could be misinterpreted as stern, but his rarely-concealed smile reminds everyone he&#8217;s simply professional to a T. All of our planning and preparation was about to pay off. As I hit John with the first question, Tyla&#8217;s still getting her makeup done off-set. With the accuracy of a seasoned professional, John keys in on me as if we&#8217;re the only two people in the room.</p>
<p>&#8220;What was the hardest part in making the transition from basketball to television?&#8221; I begin. Your biggest fear as an interviewer is that your questions will fall flat; that all you&#8217;ll get is a &#8220;Yeah, sure&#8221; or &#8220;No,&#8221; but John jumps right in. He&#8217;s a story teller, an entertainer. &#8220;To me, it was easy,&#8221; John answers. Did I mention he was humble? As we continue, I can&#8217;t help but stifle my laughter. John&#8217;s jovial delivery falls somewhere between enjoying a great stand-up comic and hanging out with that one uncle who makes you laugh-cry every Christmas.</p>
<p>His dive into cannabis has been a successful one, to say the least. Canopy Growth Corp., Canada&#8217;s largest cannabis company, was John&#8217;s first investment experience in the industry. While he&#8217;s got a chunk of other canna-businesses, I can most relate to his favorite investments: glass. &#8220;I like the intricacy [of glass rigs], but I like when they involve iridescence, when they involve colors in glass, because a lot of people don&#8217;t understand [the complexity],&#8221; shares John, likening his passion for high-quality glass to collecting fine works of art. &#8220;Jay Z&#8217;s got Picasso&#8217;s&#8212;I got rigs,&#8221; he laughs. &#8220;I clean it like it&#8217;s an old war gun, and we put it back in a safe spot, because pretty soon when I do display it, it&#8217;s gonna be in a black room, all the lights are going to be on&#8212;it&#8217;s going to be an unbelievable art show. Hopefully no one touches the rigs. Hopefully. I don&#8217;t want anybody dead that night.&#8221;</p>

			<h3>The Father-Daughter Joint Venture: Deuces</h3>
<p>&#8220;Tyla has always been on my hip since she was born,&#8221; John remarks, smiling. &#8220;She&#8217;s been my road dog since forever. The fact that she smoked cannabis and enjoys cannabis in all forms, I said, &#8216;We shouldn&#8217;t just smoke it, we should own it and be in the business with it.&#8217; And that&#8217;s been it.&#8221; But creating a business&#8212;particularly as a father-daughter duo&#8212;is no joke. Starting out in the cannabis space is like throwing yourself (and your emotional stability) into hyperdrive. Most businesses don&#8217;t get beyond a concept in their first year, but Deuces has nailed down the essentials of their product procurement, marketing and packaging in that same amount of time. But don&#8217;t get it twisted&#8212;it&#8217;s not just John making it all happen.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we were talking about the pre-rolls,&#8221; remembers John, &#8220;[at] first they were in [a] tin, it was dope, it was great. And one day, on the phone, Tyla goes, &#8216;Nah, I don&#8217;t want that anymore&#8217;&#8212;the whole packaging! I thought I was working with Michael Kors or something, she just tripped out, woke up one morning and was like&#8221;&#8212;he mimes smoking, and stares off into space for effect&#8212;&#8220;&#8216;You know what? Cars should be electric.&#8217; And she changed the pre-roll.&#8221; But, as John concedes to Tyla, &#8220;You were right about the pre-roll!&#8221;</p>
<p>Their partnership is rooted in a shared passion for quality product and a drive to be the best at whatever they do. As Tyla emphasizes, &#8220;I was very, very, <em>very </em>particular about who grew [the cannabis], what paper we use, what filters we use, how it was rolled . . . &#8221; The hurdles she faces are ones you might anticipate; she&#8217;s 21 and the daughter of a basketball legend. Everyone still sees her as &#8220;daddy&#8217;s little girl.&#8221; And, as Tyla admits, &#8220;I know I&#8217;m very fortunate in my opportunities,&#8221; but that in no way reduces her contribution to the company. If anything, seeing beyond her privileges adds to her worth. She sums it up best by stating, &#8220;I feel like Deuces is my opportunity to prove myself as a business woman, and as a company owner.&#8221;<strong>&#160;</strong></p>
<p>From NBA champion to talk show host, renowned health advocate and cannabis mogul, John Salley seems to have it all figured out. From what I can tell, his secret isn&#8217;t a secret at all&#8212;it&#8217;s what he&#8217;s professed for years: &#8220;I no longer wanted to be fed stuff. I [want] to literally make the best things for myself, for my family, and then pass that out [to the world].&#8221; That&#8217;s how he gets up and keeps hustling every day. Whether it&#8217;s a 15-year professional basketball career or diving head-first into one of the most aggressive markets since the tech boom, it&#8217;s his work ethic and family that carry him through. If you care about what you&#8217;re doing and who you&#8217;re doing it with, you&#8217;ll keep marching happily forward, and success will find you.</p>

Though his 529-358-1 record at the school while at the helm of the team is quite impressive, it was his inability to keep his political beliefs separate from the coaching duties that thrust him into the spotlight this week &#8212; ultimately costing him his job.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An </span><a href="http://kdvr.com/2018/02/28/texas-college-coach-wont-recruit-from-colorado-over-trouble-passing-drug-tests/?utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;utm_content=5a97d05104d301302cea1741&amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">email Jeffcoat sent</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> to a high school player from Colorado was made public this week, exposing a questionable recruiting policy that Jeffcoat implied the school abides by. The email thanked Cherokee Trail High School senior Gavin Bell for his interest in playing for Texas Wesleyan, but informed him that &#8220;unfortunately, we are not recruiting players from the state of Colorado.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The email went on to explain that &#8220;in the past, players have had trouble passing our drug test. We have made a decision to not take a chance on student-athletes from your state. You can thank your liberal politicians.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perusing the current roster for Texas Wesleyan, you&#8217;ll find that the majority of the university&#8217;s players hail from Texas, but one lone Coloradan suits up for the Rams. Jeffcoat&#8217;s allegation that players from Colorado &#8220;have had trouble passing&#8221; the team drug test cast shade on a single player from the state who has, thus far, maintained a clean public record.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to get anybody in trouble here,&#8221; Bell, an outfielder, said. &#8220;My intention wasn&#8217;t trying to get this guy fired. My intention was just to try to play baseball.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite Bell&#8217;s efforts to keep Jeffcoat from losing his job, the school held a </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/89174607059/videos/10155435288137060/"><span style="font-weight: 400">press conference</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> Thursday to address concerns about the issue and announce that Jeffcoat had been relieved of his coaching duties. According to the university, &#8220;the comments he made are in no way a reflection of Texas Wesleyan University, its values or its recruiting practices.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Mike Jeffcoat is no longer an employee of Texas Wesleyan University,&#8221; said Fred Slabach, school president of Texas Wesleyan. &#8220;He was separated from the university due to the discriminatory remarks contained in an email to a potential recruit from the state of Colorado and for another factor that we have been investigating for the last week. This additional factor is an NAIA (National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics) rule violation that has recently come to our attention.&#8221;</span></p>

			<p>At a time when the U.S. Department of Justice is increasingly hostile toward the marijuana industry, experts said the best way for MJ businesses to keep federal law enforcement at bay is compliance with state laws and best business practices.</p>
<p>One important way to do that is through insurance, which more states are requiring marijuana businesses to have.</p>
<p>&#8220;Being in compliance is the main thing that we want to show the Department of Justice, and part of that is going to be insurance,&#8221; said Patrick McManamon, CEO of Cannasure Insurance Services, a Westlake, Ohio-based brokerage that recently launched a line of products for marijuana businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just making sure you as a business are checking all the boxes that your state is requiring of you to operate will go a long way.&#8221;</p>
<p>But many marijuana entrepreneurs remain hesitant to get insurance for various reasons.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cannabisbenchmarks.com/annual-review-and-outlook-2017-2018-edition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-66014" src="https://mjbizdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1.png" alt="" width="300"></a>Some fear that information about their businesses shared with entities like insurance companies could be easily accessed by federal authorities.</p>
<p>Others don&#8217;t believe insurance is worth the cost or simply don&#8217;t know it&#8217;s available.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure there are a lot of growers that don&#8217;t get insurance because it is expensive,&#8221; said Jerry Derevyanny, an attorney and vice president of the Washington CannaBusiness Association, which specializes in insurance questions.</p>
<p><strong>Costly expense</strong></p>
<p>Marijuana companies face significantly more costly policies than do mainstream businesses, said Derevyanny, who is also general counsel of Northwest Cannabis Solutions, one of Washington state&#8217;s larger cultivators.</p>
<p>Derevyanny said Northwest Cannabis Solutions&#8217; insurance premiums cost hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if some (MJ business owners) just can&#8217;t afford the premiums, and some are probably rolling the dice on not needing certain coverage.&#8221;</p>
<p>In California, basic insurance for cultivators costs $20,000-$30,000 per year, said Mike Aberle, head of the insurance section of the California Cannabis Industry Association and&#160;senior vice president of Next Wave Insurance Services.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Golden State retailers face policy rates ranging from a few thousand dollars to $200,000 annually.</p>
<p>In established cannabis markets such as Colorado, Washington state and Nevada, finding insurance agents who work with marijuana businesses remains relatively easy compared to other industrywide issues like finding <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/19-attorneys-general-urge-congress-give-cannabis-states-access-banking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">banking services</a> or <a href="https://mjbizmagazine.com/digital-issues/2017-08-Sep/#70" target="_blank" rel="noopener">real estate</a>.</p>
<p>But &#8220;ease&#8221; in the marijuana industry is relative, and finding the right insurance carrier and coverage for your business still requires hard work.</p>
<p>According to industry observers, MJ business owners must:</p>
<ul>
<li>Exercise due diligence on policies available to them.</li>
<li>Be willing to shop around for policies that meet their needs.</li>
<li>Be careful not to invest in unnecessary policies.</li>
</ul>
<p>&#8220;There are only a handful of companies out there that are operating in this space with any consistency,&#8221; McManamon said.</p>
<p>&#8220;For business owners, it&#8217;s about finding the right agent that understands the marketplace.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Will insurer pay out?</strong></p>
<p>There have been cases where insurance companies have sold policies to marijuana businesses and then haven&#8217;t paid on claims, creating a big question for companies looking to buy coverage.</p>
<p>The argument: They aren&#8217;t permitted to cover a claim for a business engaged in federally illegal activity.</p>
<p>For example, Atain Specialty Insurance&#160;<a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/colorado-court-finds-some-legal-marijuana-insurable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejected a claim</a> filed in 2016 by The Green Earth Wellness on marijuana that was damaged during a Colorado wildfire.</p>
<p>Atain refused payment because the cannabis was federal contraband.</p>
<p>A U.S. district court in Colorado, however, ruled that Atain must pay the claim because marijuana&#8217;s state-legal status undermined the assertion the marijuana was contraband.</p>
<p>&#8220;More attorneys are willing to fight for the (policyholders) because it&#8217;s a legal practice,&#8221; Aberle said.</p>
<p>Though some case law backs up marijuana business insurance claims, cannabis companies still must vet the policies they are considering to ensure there are no loopholes &#8211; or, in insurance lingo, exclusions &#8211; that insurers can use to avoid paying claims.</p>
<p>The most common exclusions encountered by marijuana businesses involve terms such as &#8220;Schedule 1,&#8221; &#8220;federally illegal&#8221; and &#8220;health hazard.&#8221;</p>
<p>For example, some agents have been known to offer policies that stipulate insured companies aren&#8217;t covered if they&#8217;re involved with an illegal activity or health hazard.</p>
<p>Obviously, observers said, such policies would be worthless to marijuana business owners.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s difficult to find (an insurer), you just have to do a little bit of due diligence, like you would for any business you&#8217;re looking into,&#8221; McManamon said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Vet that person like you would your attorney, your accountant. Once you find that agent, you really work with him and stick with him.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>What kind of coverage?</strong></p>
<p>The other key insurance challenge for marijuana businesses is deciding what coverage they need &#8211; or don&#8217;t need.</p>
<p>Most marijuana businesses need general liability and product liability insurance, said Derevyanny, the Washington state attorney.</p>
<p>Property liability insurance &#8211; to cover accidents and injuries that occur on a business&#8217; premises &#8211; is probably the easiest type of policy to get.</p>
<p>Only a small number of carriers underwrite such policies, which can vary in their exclusions, so insurance shoppers need a keen eye when reviewing them, Derevyanny said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your property coverages are where you&#8217;re going to start to see some differences,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and the product liability can vary as well, depending on what your business is.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some bigger insurance carriers will offer coverage against employee malfeasance, as well as earthquakes and fire.</p>
<p>But the latter policies will cover only a building that&#8217;s damaged or destroyed, not the product or equipment inside, Derevyanny said.</p>
<p>&#8220;A dispensary is going to be concerned about finished product or finished stock inventory,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>Cannabis growers and manufacturers have different coverage needs,&#160;Derevyanny said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Cultivators will have finished product but also product that is in process,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Those guys will need plant coverage and potentially goods in process.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your infused product manufacturers, most of them probably aren&#8217;t growing product, so they&#8217;re not going to be concerned about living-plant coverage,&#8221;&#160;Derevyanny added, noting those businesses need policies that cover &#8220;goods in process, stock and inventory.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot to consider when contemplating insurance coverage, but getting a policy is a smart business move,&#160;McManamon said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This helps the industry grow, because banking and insurance offer legitimacy to businesses,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is one more thing you can hang your hat on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Idaho is one of the most staunchly anti-cannabis states in the country. <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">Cannabis</a> advocates have not been able to make much headway inside the generally very conservative state. With lawmakers now considering a new medical marijuana bill, things could be changing. But even if Idaho is getting closer to legalizing medical cannabis, will very much change on the ground for actual cannabis consumers?</p>
<h2>Idaho&#8217;s Latest Medical Marijuana Bill</h2>
<p>Lawmakers in Idaho are once again looking at a proposal to legalize medical marijuana. This most current bill would legalize certain types of <a href="https://hightimes.com/sponsored/make-sure-cbd-oil-legal-high-quality/">CBD oil</a>.</p>
<p>In particular, the bill would let people with qualifying health conditions use <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/cannabidiol-cbd/">CBD</a> oil that contains little to no <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/science/thc-tetrahydrocannabinol/">THC</a> if they received a prescription from a licensed healthcare professional.</p>
<p>As local news source&#160;<a href="http://www.kmvt.com/content/news/Idaho-House-OKs-bill-allowing-use-of-marijuana-derivative-475465333.html" rel="nofollow">KMVT 11</a> reported, the bill would also allow parents to legally possess CBD oil for their children.</p>
<p>So far, the bill has fared surprisingly well&#8212;especially given that Idaho has remained one of the states most adamantly opposed to any form of cannabis.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>In fact, the bill just cleared the Idaho House of Representatives. Members of the House voted 59-11 in favor of the proposal yesterday.</p>
<p>The bill now moves on to the Senate. If it&#8217;s approved there, it will be sent to the governor&#8217;s desk where it will be either signed into law or vetoed.</p>
<h2>A Veto Seems Likely</h2>
<p>Unfortunately for patients in Idaho who want to use medicinal cannabis, it seems very unlikely that the bill will succeed. Even if it clears the Senate,&#160;<a href="https://hightimes.com/news/idaho-governor-requests-for-trump-to-crackdown-on-weed/">Idaho Governor C.L. &#8220;Butch&#8221; Otter</a> has made it very clear that he does not support cannabis at any level.</p>
<p>On the same day that the Idaho House approved the new medical marijuana bill, Otter spoke at a city hall meeting in Firth, Idaho. Somebody at the event brought up the bill and asked the governor about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s never been my design to say I&#8217;m going to veto a bill or I&#8217;m going to sign a bill,&#8221; Otter <a href="https://idahostatejournal.com/news/local/idaho-governor-hints-at-cannabis-oil-veto-during-east-idaho/article_fed264fb-e7dd-566c-95c0-86aa5a845dae.html" rel="nofollow">said</a>. But then, seemingly contradicting that statement, he commented on Idaho&#8217;s CBD oil bill by saying: &#8220;Well, I vetoed it once.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>From there, he claimed that legalizing <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/cannabidiol-cbd/">CBD</a> would open the door to a more robust medical marijuana program and possibly even full legalization, both of which he explicitly opposes.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it could be just the beginning,&#8221; Otter said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the camel&#8217;s nose under the tent. We&#8217;ll find ourselves with a camel inside and you&#8217;re outside.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;Idaho Is Getting Closer To Legalizing Medical Cannabis</h2>
<p>For the medical marijuana community in Idaho, it is certainly a good sign that this latest bill has so far cleared one legislative branch.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it seems likely that the bill has a long uphill battle before it ever becomes law. Most alarming,&#160;Governor Otter has already vetoed at least one medical marijuana bill.</p>
<p>In 2015, Idaho lawmakers approved a proposal to make it legal for parents to possess CBD oil to treat kids with severe <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/cbd/research-under-way-to-test-marijuana-extract-as-an-epilepsy-treatment/">epilepsy</a>.</p>
<p>But Otter rejected it. His comments at yesterday&#8217;s city hall meeting clearly hinted that he would repeat that veto. Even if this newest bill makes it past the Senate.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>After my last article, which expounded the <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/the-avid-dabber-carb-cap-dabs">value of using a carb cap when you dab</a>, I thought I&#8217;d follow up with some insight into the tools I use to serve my dabs. So let&#8217;s get right to the scoop!</p>
<p>Cannabis resin is sticky. When that resin is separated, extracted, collected, or concentrated, it can be challenging to work with. That&#8217;s why proper dab tools, sometimes referred to as <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/8-creative-dab-tools-for-your-dabbing-station">dabbers</a>, are an essential accessory for any dab session. Tools allow you to work with, dose, and apply your dab safely and effectively.</p>

<p>Unless you&#8217;re working with concentrates that are extremely stable like isolates or <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/what-is-cannabis-oil-shatter-and-wax">shatter</a>, you&#8217;ll need a tool. Dab tools offer more precision when applying your dab to your nail, as well as keep you from wasting any of your precious stash. They also keep things from getting too sticky and help you avoid burnt fingers as you take your dab.</p>

<p>Dab tools come in all kinds of different styles and materials. I&#8217;ve seen people use everything from dental tools to paperclips, and just about everything in between. The most important factor for a dab tool is that they are heat-resistant, so they don&#8217;t melt or degrade when dabbing on a hot surface. They should also be inert materials that will not disrupt the flavor or composition of the dab. Instead of breaking down every single tool, I want to share a few that I keep in my arsenal and use almost every day.</p>

<p>A scoop-style dab tool is crucial. It lets you spoon up chunks of hash that might otherwise be too sticky to handle. I usually use my scoop tool when I am dabbing budders, crumbles, and sometimes isolates like crystalline <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/what-is-thca-and-what-are-the-benefits-of-this-cannabinoid">THCA</a> and <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/cannabinoids-101-what-makes-cannabis-medicine">CBD</a>. A good scoop will function like a small spoon, allowing you to shovel your dab up and drop it onto the nail. I like my scoop to have a bit of a &#8220;blade&#8221; on the tip so I can cut into the more solid forms of concentrates and break off just the right size dab.</p>

<p>The tool and carb cap combo is my go-to anytime I&#8217;m dabbing on my electronic nail. It consolidates my accessories and makes sure my carb cap is never out of reach. The carb cap fits perfectly over the dish of my e-nail and the subtle scoop on the end allows me to collect hash whether it&#8217;s sticky or stable.</p>

<p>Glass tools are some of my favorites. They tend to be easy to clean, artistic, and look good sitting next to my other glassware. The smooth surface of rounded glass can make tooling certain forms of hash more difficult, unless they&#8217;ve been made with scoops or blades as part of their design. I like to use glass tools on my heady <a href="https://www.leafly.com/products/dabbing/dab-and-oil-rigs">dab rigs</a> and nice quartz to avoid any unnecessary scraping from metal tools. I find glass tools to be great for sticky forms like live resins and sugar crystal.</p>

<p>A blade or paddle is a tool that offers a bit of a scoop or a sharper edge that allows you to cut through some of the more stable forms of hash. I like to use my bladed tool to cut a slice off a rosin patty or to divide up some stable pull-n-snap. The paddle is good for viscous materials that can be a combination of gooey and solid. A happy medium between a straight tool and a scoop, paddle tools are extremely versatile.</p>

<p>This week&#8217;s avid dab features two of my favorite brands in Washington, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/aurumfarms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aurum Farms</a> and <a href="https://www.leafly.com/brands/x-tracted" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Refine</a>. Aurum grows some amazing flower and has many of my favorite gassy <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/humulene-caryophyllene-and-trans-nerolidol-what-are-the-benefits">terps</a> in their quiver of genetics. Refine has a reputation as an industry leader in the extraction space and has always produced fantastic concentrates. Any of their Loud Resin products are fantastic, flavorful, and potent.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/in-photos-these-dragon-balls-contain-3000-grams-of-pure-cannabis"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/14152944/Dragonball-1-web-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">In Photos: These &#8216;Dragon Balls&#8217; Contain 3,000 Grams of Pure Cannabis Oil</div></div></a></div>
<p>The ooey-gooey terp jelly pictured is Caesar, a pungent hybrid of <a href="https://www.leafly.com/hybrid/gg-4">GG4</a> and Triple OG bred by <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/industry/interview-cannabis-breeder-exotic-genetix">Exotic Genetix</a>. I swooped this hash from the good people at <a href="https://www.leafly.com/dispensary-info/herban-legends">Herban Legends</a> in Seattle. The flavors are a mix of sharp diesel fuel mixed with earthy, piney sweetness. At 75.76% total cannabinoids, this Loud Resin packs a potent punch without sacrificing any of the fresh terpenes I love. If you haven&#8217;t had a chance to try Refine or Aurum, I recommend you make it a priority on you next trip to the dispensary.</p>

<p>A group supporting the legalization of marijuana has come up with a nifty fundraising scheme: Rolling papers with the attorney general&#8217;s image on the packaging.</p>
<p>Who better to poke fun at than the cluelessly anti-marijuana Sessions&#8212;the man who claims &#8220;good people&#8221; don&#8217;t smoke pot, that marijuana is a gateway drug, and who once said he liked the local Ku Klux Klan boys until he found out they smoked weed?on&#8217;t Beauregard That Joint My Friend.&#8221;</p>

Not to let legal speak take you away from imagining your happy place, but we should mention that Marijuana.com is owned by Weedmaps.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Over the course of their trip, athletes from the Weedmaps surf, skate, and motocross teams converged on the cannabis-centric compound to reconnect with friends, compete in the DaHui Backdoor Shootout and try cannabis products to aid in their recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether the athletes needed CBD to recover from a fresh injury or some Indica flower to wind down at the end of the night in preparation for early morning swells, there was something for everyone this year at WM Pipe House.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here are some of the athlete&#8217;s most loved products (in no particular order), including some honest testimonials from some who needed the products most throughout the trip.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hawaii has maintained a certain purity in isolation from the rest of the world, and smokers of Indica impresarios </span><a href="https://weedmaps.com/brands/west-coast-cure/flower" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">West Coast Cure&#8217;s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> namesake strain WCC OG enjoy the same level of immaculacy thanks to nitrogen-sealed packaging that keeps your flowers fresh until the very moment you&#8217;re ready to enjoy them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">WM skate team rider Boo Johnson experienced firsthand how effective&#160;WCC OG really was at diminishing pain and muscle tension in the body, using the cultivar as a comprehensive health plan for the duration of his stay at Pipe House.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76350" src="https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/6A6A4037-copy.jpg" alt="pipe-house-weedmaps-west-coast-cure-wcc" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/6A6A4037-copy.jpg 1000w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/6A6A4037-copy-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/6A6A4037-copy-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/6A6A4037-copy-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The vibe was lavish,&#8221; Boo told Marijuana.com. &#8220;The first joint in the morning had me viewing the beaches through a whole new viewpoint, it was rad. I&#8217;m a huge OG fan and West Coast Cure&#8217;s are A1, they brought a whole new aspect to my trip.&#8221;</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pungent citrus notes of </span><a href="https://weedmaps.com/brands/paris-og/flower" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Spacewalker OG</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> were perfect for island living, so this Paris OG highlight became a fan favorite in the Pipe House. The cross of OG Kush and Skywalker OG is known for mellow full-body effects that pair with intense cerebral pleasure, making it the essential hammock weed at the end of a long day of shredding.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-76352" src="https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/6A6A2114-copy.jpg" alt="weedmaps-pipe-house" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/6A6A2114-copy.jpg 1000w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/6A6A2114-copy-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/6A6A2114-copy-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/6A6A2114-copy-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Athletes like skater Marius Syvanen flocked to Spacewalker OG for its out-of-this-world ability to bring them to euphoric places at warp speed.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Weedmaps Pipe House experience wasn&#8217;t all about rest and relaxation, as the entire squad was out stacking clips all day, collecting bumps, bruises, and broken bones along the way. While smoking some flower is a great way to combat the grueling toll on the body these guys take at work every day, CBD can take it to the next level, incorporating additional healing properties into the pain relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Flav&#8217;s line of </span><a href="https://weedmaps.com/brands/flav/medical/topicals" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">CBD products</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> kept the team feeling great at Pipe House this year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I used the Flav CBD salve and the extra strength roll-on topical a lot, actually,&#8217;&#8221; said pro skater Tommy Sandoval. &#8220;The extra-strength is a lifesaver after a long day with sore muscles. I use the salve as more of an all-day thing or whenever I&#8217;m feeling achy or just trying to warm up on the way to the next spot. I&#8217;ll throw it on my knees a lot just to get loose.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a paradise like Hawaii, exotic strains are a must, so </span><a href="https://weedmaps.com/brands/connected-cannabis-co/flower" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Connected Cannabis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> came through in the clutch with some of their Guava flower.

					<p>A new UK bill could give hope to millions of people suffering unnecessarily, allowing them to choose their medical path.<span id="more-69781"></span></p>
<p>For much of my adult life I&#8217;ve had to rise each morning and battle multiple sclerosis. Sometimes it&#8217;s a thankless task &#8211; my legs scissored together, locked in spasm as I fight to break free of its stranglehold.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m convinced cannabis has allowed me to live more of a normal life than would have been possible with the constant pain. I&#8217;ve always smoked it. But in recent years I&#8217;ve been making cannabis oil and turning it into tinctures. A few drops of my special brew numbs any niggling aches, clear my mind and help me get a good night&#8217;s sleep, spasm-free.</p>

<p>District Attorney General Jennings H. Jones said in a Wednesday release that the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation has backed off its initial determinations. The TBI said investigators could not determine whether the cannabidiol in the products derived from marijuana or hemp.</p>

<p>Jones says the TBI had previously assured his office that the 23 Rutherford County stores were selling products infused with illegal controlled substances, which formed the basis for nuisance actions and the indictments of 21 people.</p>
<p>TBI spokesman Josh Devine said in a statement to WSMV-TV that the agency&#8217;s role in laboratory work was to objectively analyze evidence, not determine legality.</p>

<p>With mid-term elections coming up later this year, campaigning efforts are getting underway. Already, one overtly pro-cannabis candidate is making headlines. As part of his new website, an Illinois Congressional candidate smokes <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a> for a campaign ad.</p>
<h2>A Weed-Smoking Candidate</h2>
<p>Benjamin Thomas Wolf is a Democratic candidate running for the 5th Congressional District in Illinois. In preparation for the primary vote on March 20, Wolf has been stepping up his campaign efforts.</p>
<p>Most recently, that means making his support of weed explicitly clear. A new campaign ad published on the homepage of Wolf&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wolfforcongress.org" rel="nofollow">website</a>&#160;features a photo of the candidate sitting in a chair holding a joint and surrounded by smoke. A painting of a U.S. flag is behind him.</p>
<p>Directly beneath the photo, Wolf&#8217;s attitude on weed is articulated clearly and simply. The ad says &#8220;Legalize cannabis. Vote March 20th.&#8221;</p>
<p>Wolf is a former FBI operative and U.S. diplomat. And, as it turns out, he&#8217;s also a big fan of cannabis. According to his website and recent interviews, he likes weed for several important reasons.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">

		</div>

<p>&#8220;As a cannabis user, I think it&#8217;s important we get out front and talk about it,&#8221; he told <a href="http://www.dailyherald.com/news/20180226/congressional-candidate-smokes-joint-in-new-ad" rel="nofollow">news sources</a> recently. &#8220;We realize that cannabis can bring billions of dollars to the state, it&#8217;s <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/legalization/dea-chief-admits-pot-has-great-promise-as-medicine/">medicine</a> for millions of people around the country, it changes criminal justice reform and personally I think it&#8217;s a wonderful recreational substance as well.&#8221;</p>
<p>Now, Wolf is making his pro-weed position a key piece of his campaign platform. In particular, he is calling for the legalization of cannabis. Additionally, he has floated plans to spend state revenues from legal weed on public education and drug rehab programs. Finally, Wolf is also pushing to <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/colorado-release-prisoners-marijuana-convictions/">pardon</a> anyone serving time for weed-related charges.</p>
<p>His website includes a list of key platform positions. One of them is &#8220;the immediate legalization of marijuana and hemp for both medicinal and recreational uses in all U.S. states, cities, and territories.&#8221;</p>
<p>The site also says: &#8220;This will bring billions of dollars in tax revenue and allow major reform in our criminal justice system.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>Final Hit:&#160;Congressional Candidate Smokes Marijuana For Campaign Ad</h2>
<p>Wolf&#8217;s pro-weed position could be a big deal in Illinois. The state has seen a number of reforms on the cannabis law front, but no legalization.</p>
<p>For example, the city of Chicago passed an ordinance to decriminalize cannabis in 2011.&#160;Despite this effort to reform weed laws, reports in more recent years have uncovered stark <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/chicago-cops-still-busting-african-americans-for-marijuana-despite-decriminalization/">racial disparities</a> in how these laws are enforced.</p>
<p>These reports found that people of color are consistently arrested and cited more frequently than white people for marijuana possession.</p>
<p>Then, in 2016, the rest of the state followed suit. That year, Illinois lawmakers decriminalized weed. And at the beginning of 2018, an Illinois judge <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/judge-expands-illinois-medical-marijuana-program/">expanded the state&#8217;s list of health conditions</a> that qualify for medical marijuana.</p>
<p>In the past couple years, there has been a lot of speculation that Illinois could be one of the <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/legalization/states-pass-marijuana-laws-year/">next states to legalize</a> recreational cannabis. But progress seemed to slow down when Governor Bruce Rauner said he <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/illinois-governor-not-likely-allow-marijuana-legalization/">would not support a legalization bill</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do not support legalizing marijuana. I think it&#8217;s a mistake,&#8221; he said in late 2017. Rauner said that the state should take more time to study the implications of legalization before making any legal alterations.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>But things could change if outspoken pro-cannabis lawmakers and candidates like Wolf end up winning seats in Illinois this year.</p>

<p>As you probably know by now, celebrities smoking weed is <a href="https://hightimes.com/culture/music/11-of-our-favorite-celebrity-stoner-dads/">quite commonplace</a>. More and more, those in the spotlight have opened up about their <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> usage&#8212;past, present and future. The latest A-lister to disclose their marijuana&#160;use over the years was Charlize Theron, who admitted to being a hardcore wake-and-baker in her heyday.</p>
<h2>Charlize Theron&#8217;s Pot Passion</h2>
<p>In an <a href="http://www.eonline.com/news/916572/charlize-theron-admits-to-being-a-wake-and-baker-during-younger-years" rel="nofollow">interview</a> with E! News&#8217;&#160;Sibley Scoles, the <em>Gringo&#160;</em>star said that when she was younger, she&#8217;d begin to smoke the minute the sun comes up.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was a wake-and-baker for most of my life,&#8221; Theron said.</p>
<p>Despite her love for weed, Theron admitted that she was somewhat of a late-bloomer&#160;when it came to toking, but she had found an instant connection.</p>
<p>&#8221; I didn&#8217;t really mess around with anything until I was much older,&#8221; Theron said. &#8220;But I really appreciated marijuana way more than alcohol or anything else&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>However, the actress also admitted that she grew out of her stoner-phase in her thirties, after experiencing lesser highs.</p>
<p>&#8220;My chemistry was really good with it when I was younger and then it just changed one day. Like, in my early thirties I just became boring on it and I would just stand in front of my fridge, so that&#8217;s no good,&#8221; Theron admitted.</p>
<p>Apparently, not everyone is fond of the munchies.</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;Charlize Theron Opens Up About Her Love of Weed</h2>
<p>While Theron is no longer a regular toker, the 42-year old actress said she wouldn&#8217;t be opposed to re-kindling the &#8216;spark she once had.&#8217; However, this time, Theron would be using her weed medicinally. Specifically, for insomnia.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m open to retrying it again because now there&#8217;s all these different strains and you can be specific with it,&#8221; she said. &#8220;And I&#8217;m actually really interested because I have really bad insomnia, and I&#8217;d much rather get off sleeping pills and figure out a strain that helps me sleep better.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>So when I have a moment, I&#8217;m actually doing that with my mom. My mom has really bad sleep too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Luckily for Theron, there are plenty of indica-dominant strains that can<a href="https://hightimes.com/grow/grow-qa-i-have-insomnia-which-strains-should-i-grow/"> help her with her sleeping issues</a>.</p>
<p>And if she feels she no longer requires the psychoactive high of a classic marijuana strain, the actress could look into a low-THC form of treatment, such as a pot-inhaler that reportedly<a href="https://hightimes.com/health/pot-inhaler-reportedly-puts-insomnia-sufferers-sleep-minutes/"> puts users to sleep in minutes</a>.</p>
<p>Each puff of the inhaler contains less than a quarter of the amount of THC than your typical joint, so she wouldn&#8217;t find herself standing in front of her fridge, gazing aimlessly.</p>
<p>Welcome to the new world of cannabis, Charlize.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>&#8220;Colorado has seen a pretty significant increase in overall premiums,&#8221; said Neil Richardson, a registered insurance agent with The Zebra, an insurance search engine behind the Zebra State of Auto Insurance 2018.</p>

<p>Colorado&#8217;s 54.2 percent increase in the average premium between 2011 and 2017 lagged only Montana at 64 percent and Mississippi at 60.3 percent and outstripped the 20 percent gain measured nationally. Those hikes don&#8217;t account for costs from the May 2017 hailstorm that hit the metro area, which <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2017/05/23/hailstorm-costliest-ever-metro-denver/">caused a record-setting $1.4 billion in damages</a>, but that event can only drive costs higher in the future.</p>
<p>Distracted driving remains a big problem, despite repeated campaigns to get people to stop using their mobile devices while driving. And there&#8217;s some evidence that legalized marijuana is having an effect on premiums, Richardson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;In every state where recreational marijuana has been legalized, with the exception of Massachusetts, car insurance rates have increased,&#8221; he said. Between 2016 and 2017, premiums rose an average of 3.2 percent in states where recreational marijuana was legal, but only 1.6 percent on average in states with a full ban still in place.</p>

<p>In a blow to medical <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> activists nationwide, a federal judge dismisses lawsuit against Jeff Sessions. The suit sought to have the government&#8217;s classification of marijuana as a Schedule 1 substance under the Controlled Substances Act unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The decision was announced Monday at the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. Judge Alvin Hellerstein ruled that he did not have the authority to do as the plaintiffs had asked.</p>
<p>Instead, the plaintiffs must follow the administrative process put in place by the DEA.</p>
<p>Judge Hellerstein made it clear that he was not ruling on the efficacy of medicinal cannabis. He said his ruling &#8220;should not be understood as a factual finding that marijuana lacks any medical use in the United States,&#8221; according to a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-lawsuit-marijuana/u-s-federal-judge-rejects-challenge-to-marijuana-prohibition-idUSKCN1GB01T" rel="nofollow">Reuters report</a>.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>Lifesaving Medicine</h2>
<p>The case has received national attention since it was filed in July of last year. Plaintiffs in the suit include former Denver Broncos defensive end Marvin Washington. Two children are also members of the suit.</p>
<p><a href="https://hightimes.com/news/12-year-old-girl-help-end-pot-prohibition/"> Alexis Bortell</a> is a 12-year-old girl from Texas. Her family moved to Colorado so they could legally acquire cannabis oil to treat her epilepsy. Jagger Cotte, 7, suffers from a terminal neurological conditions known as Leigh syndrome. Another co-litigant, Jose Belen, is a decorated Iraq War veteran who is now fighting PTSD.</p>
<p>Washington owns a company that makes <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/cannabidiol-cbd/">CBD</a> supplements for athletes. Bortell, Cotte, and Belen use cannabis therapies to treat their serious medical conditions.</p>
<p>Michael Hiller, the lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said after the case was dismissed that the case is a matter of life and death for his clients.</p>
<p>&#8220;Resigning the plaintiffs to the petitioning administrative process is tantamount to a death sentence for those patients who need cannabis to live.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>The time has come for the courts to abandon decades-old precedent, notched with obsolete technicalities, and catch up with modern science and contemporary principles of constitutional law,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Plaintiff Belen said, in an official statement shared with us, that although the judge&#8217;s decision is a setback, it won&#8217;t be the end of the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;Judge Hellerstein&#8217;s ruling is disappointing, but it is just the beginning. My fellow plaintiffs and I will continue to stand strong for the veterans and countless Americans whose lives depend on access to medical cannabis. We are on the right side of history, and we will take this fight to the Supreme Court if necessary,&#8221; said Belen.</p>
<h2>Final Hit: Federal Judge Dismisses Lawsuit Against Jeff Sessions</h2>
<p>Attorney Hiller has vowed to appeal the judge&#8217;s decision to dismiss the lawsuit.</p>
<p>&#8220;This case will continue to move forward. Notwithstanding the outcome of today, we remain confident that the final disposition of this case will include a finding that the classification of cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act is unconstitutional&#8212;freeing millions of Americans to safely treat their conditions with a plant that maintains their health and their lives,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>For the plaintiffs, Judge Hellerstein&#8217;s ruling to dismiss the case might have been the best result possible. The judge said if he had the power to decide the case, he would have ruled against them because there is no &#8220;fundamental right&#8221; to use marijuana.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

Phil Murphy</a>.</p>
<p>The Assembly Oversight Committee is set to hear from experts Monday on cannabis legalization, the first action taken in the Assembly on marijuana since new Democratic Speaker Craig Coughlin took over leadership of the chamber this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to let the committee do its work and I&#8217;m going to look at what they&#8217;ve done. Certainly on my own I&#8217;ll start to look at the issue and do what we can to get it right,&#8221; Coughlin said.</p>
<p>Monday&#8217;s hearing comes as the <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/tag/phil-murphy/">Democratic Murphy</a> is drafting his first budget, which he will unveil later this month, and as he tries to make good on promises to ramp up education and pension spending. Murphy has estimated that marijuana <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/09/15/new-jersey-marijuana-legalization-democrats/88158/">legalization could bring in roughly $300 million</a> in revenue for the state. That&#8217;s just a fraction of what he would need to finance his proposals, though the governor cautions that he won&#8217;t fulfill his pledges &#8220;overnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Murphy made no mention of the campaign pledge to legalize marijuana during an address to the state&#8217;s business and political community Thursday in Washington.</p>
<p>The issue was the talk of the state Chamber of Commerce&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/03/02/new-jersey-marijuana-cannabis/100354/">annual trip to Washington</a>, where lobbyists, politicians and entrepreneurs pack an Amtrak train to talk shop. Among lawmakers, legalization got a tepid response. Some Democrats stopped short of backing legalization.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m still researching it,&#8221; said Democratic Assemblywoman Annette Quijano. State Sen. Bob Gordon, a Democrat, said he&#8217;s a no, for now. Republicans look reluctant to get on board. Senate Republican Leader Tom Kean Jr. is opposed.</p>
<p>Other lawmakers, particularly Democratic state Sen. Ron Rice, are raising concerns. Rice says he <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/02/19/new-jersey-marijuana-legalization-decriminalization/99371/">favors decriminalization instead of full legalization</a>.</p>
<p>Scott Rudder, who supports legalization and heads the <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/02/20/new-jersey-marijuana-legalization-cannabusiness-association/99515/">New Jersey CannaBusiness Association</a>, said he&#8217;s optimistic that lawmakers will come around.</p>
<p>And at least one influential Democratic lawmaker, Sen. Nicholas Scutari, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/06/26/new-jersey-legal-marijuana-christie/82392/">has introduced legislation for legalization</a>.</p>
<p>The legislation is identical to a measure introduced in the previous session that legalizes the recreational use of marijuana for those at least 21. It permits possession of up to 1 ounce of marijuana, 16 ounces of marijuana-infused products in solids, 72 ounces in liquid form, 7 grams of concentrate and up to six immature plants.</p>
<p>The legislation would establish a Division of Marijuana Enforcement, charged with regulating the industry. The legislation also would establish a sales tax on marijuana that would rise incrementally from 7 percent to 25 percent over five years to encourage early participation, Scutari said.</p>
<p>The public&#8217;s view of legalization seems mixed. A February Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll showed 42 percent favor legalization, while roughly equal percentages of people backed either the status quo or only decriminalization. That poll surveyed 801 New Jersey residents and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 points.</p>
<p>A September 2017 Quinnipiac University poll showed that 59 percent of residents approved of marijuana legalization. The poll surveyed 1,121 voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 points.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2016/10/14/legal-marijuana-laws-by-state-map-united-states/62772/">Nine states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana</a>. New Jersey has a medical marijuana program that Murphy has said he wants to expand.</p>

<p>From quality to products and even vernacular, the past several years have brought rapid growth, change, and innovation to areas restricted by harsh marijuana laws in very specific ways.</p>
<h2>Low-Grade &#8216;Middies&#8217; to Incredible Bud</h2>
<p>The days of middies (slang for &#8220;mid-grade&#8221; bud) seem far behind us, but it wasn&#8217;t long ago that low-grade, dried out weed was not only common, but the standard. It almost resembled <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/photos-prove-government-grown-cannabis-basically-ditch-weed">government ditch weed</a> over the gorgeous purple nugs lining <a href="https://www.leafly.com/finder">dispensary shelves</a> today. In that time, a low-grade stash was enjoyed best in <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/how-to-roll-blunt-step-by-step-guide">blunts</a> or joints, begrudgingly in pipes, and made only slightly more tolerable by bongs.</p>
<p>Despite the quality, not even a decade ago it was uncommon to find cannabis reaching anything better than mids. Now, the landscape has shifted into an almost <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/gorgeous-pictures-of-cannabis-in-various-forms">unrecognizable display</a>. Legalization has changed the way we all look at cannabis quality. After all, it&#8217;s hard to want what you&#8217;ve never had, but in a world where one can simply hop on a plane to Colorado and smoke some superb <a href="https://www.leafly.com/sativa/jack-herer">Jack Herer</a>, middies just aren&#8217;t going to cut it after experiencing full-flavored, trichome-covered nugs.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/what-are-the-strongest-cannabis-strains"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/12002953/what-are-the-strongest-cannabis-strains-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">What Are the Strongest Cannabis Strains?</div></div></a></div>
<h2>From a Change in Quality to a Change in Language</h2>
<p>Not only is the cannabis changing, the vernacular is shifting right behind it. The word &#8220;headies&#8221; (slang for cannabis with powerful effects) has faded from use because nowadays, high-quality is the standard. Learning the distinction from middies and headies? Sativa vs. indica? THC or CBD? Citrus or diesel <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/terpenes-the-flavors-of-cannabis-aromatherapy">terpenes</a>?&#160;These nuances may seem trivial to those who live in places like California, where legal, professionally grown cannabis has been available in some form or another for over 20 years, but for prohibition states, the changes are amazing to see.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/glossary-of-cannabis-terms"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/29195142/glossary-of-cannabis-terms-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Leafly Glossary of Cannabis Terms</div></div></a></div>
<p>What&#8217;s more, the evolution has not been limited to the quality of flower. Edibles have also undergone a significant change. The best you could find in the cannabis culinary world were some dark green middies-made butter and too much sugar in dried-out brownies or skunky cookies. They were unpredictable at best, and as for dosage? Forget it. You never knew if you were going to be couch-locked for days or feel nothing at all.</p>
<p>But as time marches on, knowledge from <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/lifestyle/edibles-evolved-how-an-award-winning-pastry-chef-is-transforming">professional cannabis chefs</a> and bakers in legal states has become widely accessible and constantly evolving. A few clicks on the internet can guide just about anybody to create tried-and-true edibles for any occasion, from infused <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/lifestyle/infuse-hanukkah-recipes-with-cannabis">Hanukkah treats</a> to full-on <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/lifestyle/3-delicious-cannabis-infused-vegan-recipes">vegan meals</a>. With legalization, the guesswork is gone&#8212;it has granted freedom to develop <a href="https://www.leafly.com/products/edibles">tasty edibles</a> in proper environments with a world of delicious ingredients at hand, and prohibition states are just as happy to reap the rewards.</p>

<h2>Souped-Up Products and Potent Oils</h2>
<p>Most recently, another big change has begun to take place in the cannabis community&#8212;the rise of <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/what-are-pre-filled-cannabis-oil-vape-cartridges">oil pens</a>. The first introduction to oil that prohibition states saw were <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/is-dabbing-good-or-bad-or-both">dabs</a>, starting around five years ago with a burst of popularity. However, as people began to see the perks of oil, it was the pen that eventually took off with a huge fanbase. Oil pens are convenient, flavorful, <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/best-discreet-vape-pens-and-portable-vaporizers">discreet</a>, highly potent, and have a long shelf life, resulting in more and more people discovering the economical, medicinal, and recreational advantages of this product type. Prohibition states have legalization and cannabis tourism to thank for popularizing this product.</p>

<h2>Moving Forward as More States Legalize</h2>
<p>Legalization will continue to grow each year as the benefits of cannabis are observed in states that have already embraced this new freedom. We may think of these observable perks as economical, with legal states <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/industry/colorado-hits-billion-dollar-sales-mark-in-nine-months">earning a billion</a> (or greater) in legal cannabis profits per year. However, the impact is being felt on an individual level as well. With cannabis tourism growing, so does the way in which people from around the country think of and view cannabis. This positive exposure is another driving factor for constituents to push for legalization in their own state.</p>
<p>It makes you want to demand better. The phrase &#8220;The grass is always greener on the other side&#8221; is usually a warning, but when it comes to legalization, the grass really is greener&#8212;and more potent, too.</p>

INSERT INTO articles VALUES (12541, 'Investing in CBD Companies? Watch for These Warning Signs', NULL, 'hemp-derived-cbd-1280x800.jpg', '<div class="uncode_text_column"><p>Interest in cannabidiol (CBD) has taken off over the past five years since Sanjay Gupta, the Chief Medical Correspondent at CNN, highlighted its promise in the documentary <em>Weed</em>. GW Pharma (NASDAQ: GWPH) has submitted a New Drug Application for its CBD-based Epidiolex with the FDA, and it is probable that the agency will approve it later this year. That would mark the first time a pharmaceutical derived from botanical cannabis, which is likely to fuel even more interest in the cannabinoid.<br>
</p>
<div id="leafly-dfp-ad-widget-mobile-medium-rectangle-1509336932" class="leafly-dfp-ad-container">    </div>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">Consumer interest in cannabidiol has skyrocketed. The US market for hemp-derived CBD was $50 million in 2014. By 2020 it''s expected to hit $736 million.</div>
<p>CBD can be produced in a variety of ways, including both naturally and synthetically. Several biotech companies are developing pharmaceuticals based on synthetic CBD. This method may prove to be more economical in the long term if synthetic CBD is as efficacious as plant-derived CBD, but it&#8217;s too early to make that call. Zynerba (NASDAQ: ZYNE) has experienced two clinical trial failures to date, though it&#8217;s not clear that the source of CBD in their trial drug played a role in those failures. Synthetic THC has never been able to deliver the efficacy of plant-derived THC and appears to have more risk factors.</p>
<p>Botanical CBD can be extracted from cannabis plants, including the low-THC variety known as industrial hemp, which is defined as having a THC content of 0.3% or less. Many researchers believe that CBD is most efficacious when it&#8217;s delivered in combination with small amounts of THC, producing what&#8217;s known as the entourage effect. Additionally, industrial hemp plants contain relatively low amounts of CBD, meaning that a lot of plant material has to be processed to produce a small amount of CBD. That can lead to a greater risk of pesticides and other impurities in the final product.</p>
<p>And, of course, CBD may be extracted from higher-THC cannabis plants. From a business perspective, extracting CBD from non-hemp cannabis is not as legally limiting as it was just a few years ago, as most states now allow some form of legal CBD production for medical patients. But it still restricts a company to sales only within the state in which the CBD was produced.</p>
<p>CBD derived from industrial hemp gets around this limitation, though the legality isn&#8217;t particularly clear. Historically, much of the source material for hemp-derived CBD has been imported from Europe, though the Farm Act of 2014 has led to some companies perhaps pushing the envelope a bit and using domestic industrial hemp to extract CBD.</p>

<h2>Big Tobacco Entering the Space</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.hempbizjournal.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hemp Business Journal</a> suggests that the market for CBD derived from industrial hemp will grow from about $50 million in 2014 to <a href="https://www.hempbizjournal.com/the-cbd-report/">$736 million in 2020</a>.</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">Look for independent reviews on the products being sold, and ask people in the industry if they are familiar with the products or the companies.</div>
<p>Earlier this month, a global tobacco company, Alliance One (NYSE: AOI), invested <a href="https://www.newcannabisventures.com/publicly-traded-global-tobacco-company-bets-on-cannabis-alliance-one-international/">$10 million to buy a 40% stake in Criticality</a>, a company that is one of ten that are licensed by the state of North Carolina to grow industrial hemp. The company states that it intends to be a major producer of CBD from industrial hemp.</p>
<p>In Canada, several federally licensed producers of medical cannabis have made substantial investments in advance of potential regulatory changes there that will permit CBD extracted from lower-THC plants to be sold legally to all adults, not just registered medical patients.</p>
<p>With so much interest in CBD, and bigger companies starting to make investments in the sector, many investors are interested in capitalizing on the trend. Several publicly-traded companies offer the ability for anyone to invest, but I suggest being very cautious, as many of them have red flag issues in my view.</p>
<h2>Four Key Considerations</h2>
<p>Over the course of five years, I have built a list of over 600 companies that purport to be in the cannabis industry. One trend I have noticed lately has been a lot of new entrants focused on CBD extracted from industrial hemp. There are a few filters I apply when I evaluate them before diving in deeper:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Do they file with the SEC?</li>
<li>Are they generating significant revenue?</li>
<li>Does the company clearly explain the source of its CBD and the methods of production?</li>
<li>Is there any sort of independent evaluation of their products?</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>When it comes to buying into publicly traded cannabis stocks, I always caution investors to avoid companies that don&#8217;t file with the SEC, as they lack transparency. For example, company insiders can dump stock without having to file electronic disclosures. Unfortunately, a lot of these publicly traded CBD companies don&#8217;t file with the SEC.</p>
<p>Another caveat: Several of the companies that purport to be in the CBD business don&#8217;t have material operations. It&#8217;s a highly competitive space, and companies with no traction to date are very risky in my view. It&#8217;s easy to say that you are in the business, but much more difficult to actually produce and sell successful products.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/science-tech/is-more-cbd-better-the-science-behind-cbd-dosing-for-anxiety-and-other-conditions"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/14120924/cbd-anxiety-science-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Is More CBD Better? The Science Behind CBD Dosing for Anxiety and Other Conditions</div></div></a></div>
<p>Another thing I like to do when investigating these companies is to go to their website or read through their public disclosure documents to learn more about how they are making or acquiring their products. Surprisingly, many of them don&#8217;t share this information.</p>
<p>Finally, I like to look for independent reviews on the products being sold, though often they don&#8217;t exist. I will ask people in the industry if they are familiar with the brands or the companies. If that brand awareness isn&#8217;t there, I become concerned that the products may lack quality. The FDA has called out several companies over the past few years for quality issues and marketing violations (ie, making health claims). Here&#8217;s a tip: If the Hemp Business Journal doesn&#8217;t list the company, it is likely not a leader in the space.</p>
<h2>Be Careful With These CBD Sellers</h2>
<p>The list of companies that I find to be potentially troublesome as investments is much longer than those I am discussing today, but the three that stand out include Medical Marijuana, Inc. (OTC: MJNA), PotNetwork Holdings (OTC: POTN) and Ubiquitech Software (OTC: UBQU). One common characteristic is that none of them file with the SEC.</p>
<p><strong>Medical Marijuana Inc. </strong>(MJNA) began trading publicly in 2009, the first publicly-traded cannabis stock, though its original founders exited in 2011. Control of the company went to a group led by San Diego-based entrepreneur Michael Llamas. His group began developing CBD from industrial hemp in 2008. The company promised to get audited financials in 2013 and begin filing with the SEC, but still has not done so. (Llamas exited in 2012; the company is now run by <a href="http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-poway-cannabis-conglomerate-medical-marijuana-inc-2015apr12-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CEO Stuart Titus</a>.) In its financials for the quarter ending 9/30, it reported over 3.2 billion shares, meaning that the company has a market capitalization in excess of $325 million. Most of its sales are derived from its multilevel marketing arm, Kannaway. The company regularly generates large operating losses and has a significant amount of convertible debt (in excess of $11 million). Despite its long operating history, the company is very weak financially, and the valuation seems very high.</p>
<p><strong>PotNetwork Holdings</strong> (POTN) acquired First Capital Venture Holdings, the maker of <a href="https://www.diamondcbd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Diamond CBD</a>, a year ago. The company has been heavily promoting its stock, which is always a red flag. But it&#8217;s the lack of info about its products and the people behind the company that I find most disturbing. Take a hard look at the products the company markets: There&#8217;s no mention of the amount of CBD per serving or per package. The company does post some lab tests, though many them are not current. The company also makes questionable claims on <a href="https://www.diamondcbd.com/pages/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its website</a>: &#8220;Our products are legal across all fifty states, USA-made, and produced with federally-legal Cannabidiol (CBD).&#8221; The issue is that phrase &#8220;federally-legal.&#8221; In late 2016, the <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/hold-deas-move-cbd-may-not-legal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DEA declared CBD a federally illegal Schedule 1 drug</a>, although a coalition of hemp and CBD companies are currently <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/deas-ban-on-cbd-challenged-in-federal-court" target="_blank" rel="noopener">challenging the DEA&#8217;s move</a> in a San Francisco federal court.</p>

<p>Further, many states have cracked down on the sale of CBD from industrial hemp, most notably <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/indiana-ag-says-cops-can-seize-cbd-oil-unless-its-for-epilepsy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana</a>. The company&#8217;s unaudited financials suggest the company had sales of $14.5 million in 2017, with a net profit of $213,802. With 570 million shares outstanding, the stock has a market cap of $308 million, or about 20X sales, which is not justifiable in my view.</p>
<p><strong>Ubiquitech Software</strong> (UBQU), which operates <a href="https://hemplifetoday.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HempLife Today</a> and markets CannazALL CBD Products, is extremely promotional with respect to its stock as well. While the absolute valuation of the company isn&#8217;t nearly as high as the other two I have discussed, it&#8217;s important to understand that the company issues shares at $0.001 through convertible notes, a price that is about 95% below the price at which the stock trades. In fact, in the quarter ending 8/31, it issued over 147 million shares for conversion of debt. The company reported sales of $3.3 million in the first nine months of its fiscal year ending Nov. 30, 2017, and operating income of $316,000, though it&#8217;s not clear if all of the sales are from CBD products. There are few, if any, independent reviews of CannazALL products, and the <a href="https://hemplifetoday.com/about-us/">company&#8217;s website</a> provides little information about the sourcing of its CBD offerings (made in the USA) or the people running the company.</p>

<h2>Three That Look More Promising</h2>
<p>There are three companies that pass my initial screening criteria. I will mention these as being worthy of further investigation and share some brief background, but readers should not construe my comments as a recommendation.</p>
<p><strong>CV Sciences</strong> (OTC: CVSI) was actually spun out of MJNA in 2013, but it looks to be a much better company to me. Their products can be found on the shelves of health food stores, and the financials are decent. Sales in Q3 ending Sept. 30, 2017, were $5.6 million, which represents growth of 90% from a year ago. The company has a decent balance sheet with slightly positive cash flow from operations. The company is also developing a synthetic CBD and nicotine gum that it hopes to get through the FDA regulatory process. One issue that concerns me is that the <a href="https://www.newcannabisventures.com/sec-files-fraud-charges-against-michael-mona-jr-ceo-of-cbd-seller-cv-sciences-and-company/">SEC is suing the company and its CEO</a> for alleged fraud related to the spin out from MJNA. Were it not for this issue, I would be even more enthusiastic about the stock, which has a market capitalization of about $35 million, which compares quite favorably to both MJNA and POTN at over $300 million.</p>
<p><strong>Elixinol Global</strong> recently conducted an IPO in Australia and trades exclusively on the Australian Stock Exchange under the symbol of &#8220;EXL.&#8221; Elixinol has a highly regarded CBD product marketed out of Colorado, but the company has an even larger hemp food company in Australia and is expected to enter the Australian medicinal cannabis market in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Isodiol International</strong> (CSE: ISOL) (OTC: ISOLF) is based in San Diego but began trading last year in Canada. The company sells CBD products derived from industrial hemp and posted sales of C$5.06 million (roughly $4 million) for the quarter ending Sept. 30, 2017. Many of the members of the management team left MJNA to join Isodiol. The company has been able to raise significant capital through the sale of equity, and it&#8217;s vertically integrated, using its own raw ingredients to develop and offer both consumer products as well as wholesaling to other pharmaceutical companies.</p>
<p>Bottom line: CBD from industrial hemp is taking off, but investing in the industry is challenging. &#160;A few companies that are doing things the right way in my view may be worth considering, but the others are too speculative for long-term investors.</p>

<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need people using marijuana in our parks or on our sidewalks,&#8221; Rep. Jonathan Singer, D-Longmont, a sponsor of the legislation, said in a statement. &#8220;This bill will help make sure people aren&#8217;t consuming more than they should and are doing it in an environment no different than what you would see at a winery or brewery.&#8221;</p>
<p>The 23-page bill outlines a slew of dos and don&#8217;ts for the tasting rooms, with notable nos including: no food, no alcohol, no employee consumption, no free samples and no BYO cannabis.</p>
<p>The bill would allow for adult patrons to vape cannabis flower and concentrate and to sample single-serving infused products. The language establishes purchase limits of 3.5 grams of flower, or 1 gram of concentrate or the standard infused product serving size containing 10 milligrams active THC.</p>
<p>The legislature is taking another stab at state-wide regulations for social use with HB 1258. A 2016 bill <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/03/07/colorado-legislature-looks-to-address-the-wild-west-of-pot-clubs/75139/">allowed local governments to regulate pot clubs</a>, but that provision was stripped after facing <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/03/08/colorado-marijuana-bills-governor-john-hickenlooper-pot-clubs-trump-administration/75238/">opposition from Democratic Gov.

<p>U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein did not address the plaintiffs claim that marijuana has medical benefits, but said the DEA has the authority to make that decision and not the courts.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs included former NFL player Marvin Washington, the co-founder of a company that sells hemp-based sports products, Army veteran Jose Belen, who said the horrors of the Iraq War left him with post-traumatic stress disorder, and two young children who use marijuana to treat medical conditions.</p>
<p>Michael Hiller, lead attorney for the plaintiffs, said they would appeal the decision.</p>
<p>&#8220;Resigning the plaintiffs to the petitioning administrative process is tantamount to a death sentence for those patients who need cannabis to live,&#8221; said Hiller, who had earlier argued that the administrative process takes an average of nine years.</p>
<p>In a statement, Belen called the ruling disappointing, &#8220;but just the beginning.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We are on the right side of history, and we will take this fight to the Supreme Court if necessary,&#8221; Belen said.</p>
<p>Hellerstein earlier had evinced sympathy for the plaintiffs&#8217; claims that medical marijuana had helped them, but appeared to take the government&#8217;s argument seriously that the plaintiffs should petition the DEA.</p>
<p>The suit originally was filed in July as a growing number of states broke with the federal government and declared marijuana to be legal. Thirty have now legalized it in some fashion, including six for recreational use.</p>
<p>The lawsuit challenged the listing of marijuana as a Schedule I drug, a category that includes heroin and LSD. The federal government says drugs under that classification have no accepted medical use and cannot legally be prescribed.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs had asked the court for a permanent injunction preventing the government from enforcing the Controlled Substances Act as it pertains to cannabis.</p>
<p>Marijuana got its Schedule I designation as part of the ranking or &#8220;scheduling&#8221; of drugs under the 1970 act.</p>
<p>Government lawyers had argued there were logical reasons to classify marijuana as a dangerous drug under federal law.</p>
<p>A message seeking comment from the U.S. Attorney&#8217;s office was not immediately returned.</p>

<p>The evolution of Colorado&#8217;s weed scene is taking another step forward. Nearly six years after voters chose to legalize recreational <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a>, Denver will soon have its first legal recreational cannabis club. The development could introduce big changes on the specific issue of smoking in public places.</p>
<h2>Denver Approves First Weed Lounge</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/local-news/denver-approves-citys-first-legal-marijuana-club" rel="nofollow">Associated Press</a>, officials in the city of Denver have approved the city&#8217;s first weed lounge.</p>
<p>The Coffee Joint will operate as a bring your own cannabis club. That means that customers will not be able to buy weed directly on site. Similarly, there are also restrictions on how customers will be able to consume their weed.</p>
<p>The biggest restriction is that customers at the Coffee Joint will not be allowed to smoke their herb. But they will be allowed to <a href="https://hightimes.com/culture/pot-matters-vaporizer-use-among-cannabis-users/">vaporize cannabis</a> and to consume <a href="https://hightimes.com/edibles/best-edibles-2017/">edibles</a>.</p>
<p>At this point, it is unclear exactly when the lounge will open. In fact, there are still more regulatory and licensing requirements the business needs to complete before it can open.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Although the shop has received initial approval from city officials, the shop still needs to pass a few more inspections from various city agencies.&#160;After that, the lounge should be cleared to open for business.</p>
<h2>Final Hit: Denver Will Soon Have Its First Legal Recreational Cannabis Club</h2>
<p>The possibility of cannabis clubs, cafes, lounges, and bars has been a topic of conversation and debate in Colorado for a few years now.</p>
<p>In particular, it became a more pressing concern after the state voted to legalize recreational weed in 2012. At that point, it became much more urgent to figure out whether or not the state would allow any form of public consumption.</p>
<p>In late 2016, voters in Denver narrowly <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/denver-appears-to-legalize-marijuana-social-lounges/">approved a proposal to allow marijuana lounges</a>. This was essentially the city&#8217;s first attempt to establish places where people can legally consume weed in public.</p>
<p>But the process of actually opening a cannabis lounge proved to be tricky&#8212;even after voters approved the idea.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>For starters, <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/foes-of-denver-marijuana-lounges-roll-out-opposition-strategy/">opponents</a> of weed lounges began coordinating efforts to slow the process almost immediately after the 2016 vote.&#160;Many of their arguments focused on how a marijuana lounge might affect neighbors.</p>
<p>Opponents argued that such businesses would introduce unwanted <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/scientific-study-confirms-second-hand-smoke-highs-are-real/">second-hand smoke</a> to the locations where they operated. Some also expressed concern that patrons might get a little too high&#8212;especially if they&#8217;re drinking alcohol.</p>
<p>Beyond facing criticism from opponents, the law itself set up a convoluted application process. The city of Denver began accepting applications for marijuana lounges last fall. But the process of applying and getting all necessary inspections and approvals is long and sometimes tedious.</p>
<p>This is part of the reason it took nearly a year and a half after the 2016 vote before Denver finally granted its first approval for a marijuana lounge. And who knows how long it will be before the Coffee Joint is actually open.</p>
<p>Either way, the fact that&#160;Denver will soon have its first legal recreational cannabis club&#160;further solidifies Denver as one of the nation&#8217;s most progressive cannabis havens.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;" data-reactid="13">In previous studies, CBD&#226;&#128;&#148;one of the main molecules in cannabis&#226;&#128;&#148;has demonstrated sustained clinical benefits in a variety of medically refractory pediatric epilepsies, including infantile spasms, an uncommon condition estimated by the&#194;&#160;Child Neurology Foundation&#194;&#160;(CNF) to be diagnosed in about 1,200 children in the United States each year.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="14">&#226;&#128;&#156;We have great hope in the potential of our proprietary formulation of pharmaceutical-grade, synthetically manufactured CBD oral solution in combination with vigabatrin to offer greater seizure control to children with infantile spasms,&#226;&#128;&#157; said Steve Sherman, senior vice president of regulatory affairs for INSYS Therapeutics. &#226;&#128;&#156;The need for more efficacious and better tolerated products to treat this devastating disorder continues to motivate us to advance this investigational therapy through the clinical and regulatory pathway.&#226;&#128;&#157;</p>
<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="15">According to the Infantile Spasms Action Network (ISAN), a collaborative advocacy network of 25 national and international organizations convened by CNF, infantile spasms have an average age of onset of around four months, although in some cases the first seizure occurs as early as one month or as late as two years. In most cases, infantile spasms appear to be slight head drops, which belie the seriousness of the condition. Evidence shows that infantile spasms are a more serious seizure disorder than generalized convulsions.</p>

(AP) &#8212; Arkansas took the first step Tuesday toward launching its medical marijuana program, as state regulators named the five businesses they intend to license to grow the drug.</p>
<p>The state Medical Marijuana Commission announced the top applications for cultivation facilities, which will grow and provide cannabis for dispensaries to sell under a 2016 voter-approved measure. The panel is expected later this year <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/08/16/arkansas-medical-marijuana-dispensary-licenses/86222/">to license up to 32 dispensaries to sell the drug</a>.</p>
<p>The companies have seven days to pay a $100,000 licensing fee and post a $500,000 performance bond in order to receive the licenses.</p>

<p>The companies are Natural State Medicinals Cultivation in Jefferson County, Bold Team LLC in Woodruff County, Natural State Wellness Enterprises in Jefferson or Jackson County, Osage Creek Cultivation in Carroll County and Delta Medical Cannabis Company Inc. in Jackson County.</p>
<p>Natural State Wellness Enterprises&#8217; investors include former Attorney General Dustin McDaniel, who said the company hopes to decide in the next 24 to 36 hours in which county to locate. The company had two applications among the top five, but is prohibited from opening more than one facility.</p>
<p>&#8220;We appreciate that it is a public trust that has been placed upon our company to produce quality, safe, and legal medicine to Arkansas patients,&#8221; said McDaniel, who is also an attorney and lobbyist for the company. &#8220;We will make a location decision shortly and will promptly begin construction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Delta Medical Cannabis has a property under contract in Newport, about 89 miles northeast of Little Rock, and will likely have its facility up and running by the end of this year or early 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building a state of the art facility from the ground up,&#8221; said Donald Parker, an owner and attorney of the company.</p>

<hr>
<p>The state received <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/09/19/arkansas-medical-marijuana-businesses/88301/">95 applications for cultivation facilities</a>. The applications were scored by each of the five commissioners on several factors, including business experience, qualifications and finances. The commission will meet March 14 to formally award licenses to companies that complied with the requirements.</p>
<p>The state has approved more than 4,100 applications for patients to use medical marijuana, and will issue registry cards about a month before the drug is expected to be available legally.</p>
<p>The licenses were announced the same day dozens of medical marijuana supporters appeared at the state Capitol to urge lawmakers to make changes to the medical marijuana program next year. The proposals include adding qualifying medical conditions, ending a 4 percent tax on medical marijuana sales and allowing students approved to use medical marijuana to have access to non-smokeable forms of cannabis on school grounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted everyone to really understand what the real story is. It&#8217;s not about five businessmen that are going to make a lot of money,&#8221; Corey Hunt with the Arkansas Cannabis Industry Association, said. &#8220;It&#8217;s about these patients here who fought years and years and years.&#8221;</p>

<p>The country&#8217;s largest pot producer, Canopy Growth, has turned a bell-pepper farm in Aldergrove into a cannabis operation that will span 275,000 square meters, once construction is complete. That&#8217;s equivalent to nearly 176 NHL-sized hockey rinks.</p>

			<p>Canopy Growth, the largest medical cannabis company in the world by sales, is planning to list its shares on the Nasdaq, a move that would make it only the second vertically integrated MMJ business to be traded on a top American stock market.</p>
<p>CEO Bruce Linton disclosed his Nasdaq aspirations in a speech to the Economic Club of Canada on Thursday afternoon, according to a note by Vahan Ajamian, a Toronto-based analyst with Beacon Securities.</p>
<p>Linton indicated no timeline for the listing, but Ajamian estimates it could occur sometime after March.</p>
<p>Linton told about 200 people that Canopy had been making preparations to list on the Nasdaq last October, but the plan was shelved so the company could focus on sealing an <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/constellations-purchase-canopy-stake-transformative-portends-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">investment from</a> global alcohol giant Constellation Brands.</p>
<p><a href="http://info.mjfreeway.com/opt-in-consulting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-66014" src="https://mjbizdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2.26_MJ_BizAd300x250-01-1.png" alt="" width="300"></a>Now that the Constellation deal is in the clear, Canopy is apparently putting the Nasdaq listing back on the front burner.</p>
<p><strong>Start of a trend?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the second significant announcement this week connecting a major U.S. stock market to a Canadian medical cannabis company.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Cronos Group, a vertically integrated medical marijuana company, <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/cronos-lists-nasdaq-us-gets-first-pure-play-cannabis-stock-major-exchange/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">started trading</a>&#160;on the Nasdaq under the symbol <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/cron/interactive-chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRON</a>.</p>
<p>Cronos was the first plant-touching company in medical cannabis cultivation and sales to list on the Nasdaq.</p>
<p>A listing on the Nasdaq gives companies easier access to capital from institutional, strategic and retail investors.</p>
<p>Most retail investors in the United States using discount trading platforms can&#8217;t easily trade stocks on Canadian exchanges, which list about 70 cannabis companies.</p>
<p>Institutions tend to express more interest in companies traded on major exchanges, as well.</p>
<p><strong>More MJ legitimacy</strong></p>
<p>A Canopy listing would help &#8220;the average American institution get a little more comfortable with cannabis stocks,&#8221; Ajamian said.</p>
<p>Ajamian says the move would help further legitimize the entire industry in the United States.</p>
<p>&#8220;These are normal companies abiding by federal laws,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and they&#8217;re OK for investors to own.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cronos is traded on the TSX Venture Exchange under the symbol&#160;<a href="https://web.tmxmoney.com/quote.php?qm_symbol=mjn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MJN;&#160;</a>Canopy&#8217;s shares are traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange as&#160;<a href="https://web.tmxmoney.com/quote.php?qm_symbol=WEED" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WEED</a>.</p>

<p>The fight for smokable medical&#160;<a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a> in Florida goes to court in May. Medical cannabis activists are suing the state to get a ban on smokable cannabis overturned. People United for Medical Marijuana (PUFMM) filed the suit in July of last year. According to <a href="https://www.wptv.com/news/state/florida-case-on-smokable-medical-marijuana-gets-trial-date" rel="nofollow">sources</a>, Leon County Judge Karen Gievers set a trial date of May 16 in the case. Judge Gievers will hear and decide the case without the help of a jury.</p>
<p>Florida voters legalized medical marijuana by a 71 percent majority in 2016. Subsequently, the state legislature outlawed smokeable forms of cannabis in 2017. Patients would have to rely on vaping, topicals, tinctures, edibles and other non-combustible forms of cannabis. Legislators cited the health risks of smoking as the reason for the ban.</p>
<p>Attorney John Morgan of Orlando chairs PUFMM. He also led the campaign to pass Amendment 2, as the law is known. Morgan believes the ban on smokable forms of marijuana violates&#160;Amendment 2.</p>
<h2>Suit Given Go-Ahead Last Month</h2>
<p>The state tried to have the suit dismissed at a hearing in January. But plaintiffs in the case fought back. They argued that lawmakers overstepped their authority when they <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/florida-lawsuit-aims-put-medical-marijuana-program-gear/">banned smoking medical cannabis</a>.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the legislature argued that Amendment 2 gave the responsibility of implementing it to lawmakers. Judge Gievers decided in favor of the plaintiffs and said the case could continue.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

		</div>

<p>&#8220;The pending complaint contains sufficient allegations to meet the standing and active case or controversy criteria for the court to have jurisdiction over this declaratory judgment action,&#8221; the judge ruled.</p>
<p>Cathy Jordan is one of the plaintiffs in the case. She is an ALS patient who has been legally using cannabis medicinally for years due to special state authorization.</p>
<p>She and her husband Bob have lobbied for access to medical marijuana for other Florida patients. They also campaigned for the passage of Amendment 2.</p>
<p>Jon Mills is an attorney who helped write Florida&#8217;s medical marijuana law. He also represents Cathy Jordan. After Judge Gievers decided the case could continue, <a href="https://www.news4jax.com/news/florida/judge-allows-smokeable-pot-case-to-proceed" rel="nofollow">he told local media</a> he was pleased with the decision.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">

		</div>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m delighted we can move forward. I&#8217;ve spoken with Cathy Jordan and Bob. They&#8217;re very happy. We&#8217;re happy that it came so quickly. It allows us to advance the case and that&#8217;s what we intend to do.&#8221;</p>
<p>Because Jordan is older than 65, she has the right to request an expedited hearing of the case under Florida law. Mills expects to exercise that right.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want Cathy to be able to see the results as soon as possible,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>More Problems for Patients, too</h2>
<p>Patients have other complaints about the rollout of Florida&#8217;s medical marijuana problem, as well.</p>
<p>Seth Hyman buys medicinal cannabis products for his daughter Rebecca, who has a seizure disorder. Recently, <a href="http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/02/10/medical-marijuana-may-be-legal-but-patients-still-go-without-in-florida/" rel="nofollow">he told the Tampa Bay Times</a>&#160;that access to medicine is difficult.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the current system, you&#8217;re very limited to the strains of product that are available,&#8221; said Hyman. &#8220;Some patients can&#8217;t even get their medicine.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>Final Hit:&#160;The Fight For Smokable Medical Marijuana in Florida Goes To Court</h2>
<p>The case isn&#8217;t the only one against the state over its implementation of&#160; Amendment 2. Seven additional lawsuits are pending, as well. One case challenges the state&#8217;s process for issuing licenses to medical marijuana treatment centers.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a case that highlights some of the failures of unjust or inadequate student safety policies. A Georgia middle school suspends 6th grader after accidental <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> consumption. Here&#8217;s what happened late last week.</p>
<h2>A Questionable Suspension</h2>
<p>The entire ordeal started last Friday morning. That&#8217;s when an 11-year-old sixth grader named Diamond Brooks said she was given a cookie from a classmate.</p>
<p>Diamond didn&#8217;t think anything of it. She happily accepted the cookie and ate it.&#160;A short time later, she said she started feeling very confused. Eventually, Diamond was taken by ambulance to the hospital.</p>
<p>Reports from local news source <a href="http://www.wsbtv.com/news/local/family-says-student-sickened-after-eating-pot-laced-brownie-at-school/710965783" rel="nofollow">WSBTV</a> said that Diamond threw up at the hospital and continued feeling extremely disoriented.&#160;When doctors treated her, they discovered marijuana in her system. Now, the family thinks that the cookie Diamond ate at school was actually an edible.</p>
<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t pay attention when I was getting it, so I just got it and ate it,&#8221; Diamond said. &#8220;If she told me what was in it I never would have got it from her.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>At some point, school authorities learned about the incident and ended up suspending Diamond. The DeKalb County School District said they are investigating the incident while Diamond is suspended.</p>
<p>&#8220;The student ingested a dessert, but it cannot confirm if it was laced with a drug,&#8221; the county said in a statement. &#8220;Our investigation will shed more light on what occurred.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, Diamond&#8217;s family is not happy with how the school handled the situation. In particular, they are frustrated that authorities chose to suspend the sixth grader from her middle school even though Diamond maintains that she had no idea what was in the cookie.</p>
<p>&#8220;She didn&#8217;t know what it was,&#8221; Diamond&#8217;s father, Gary Brooks, said. &#8220;She didn&#8217;t intentionally do no drugs.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">

		</div>

<p>He added: &#8220;When you spike somebody&#8217;s drink, they don&#8217;t know, so they are supposed to get punished for what happened? That don&#8217;t make sense.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Final Hit: School Suspends 6th Grader After Accidental Cannabis Consumption</h2>
<p>The family said they are pressing the district to reverse its ruling and let Diamond return to school. So far, the suspension remains in place. Additionally, it is unclear whether or not the school has taken any actions regarding the student who allegedly gave Diamond the cookie.</p>
<p>In many ways, the entire incident highlights some of the potential dangers of zero tolerance policies. Rather than providing extra support for Diamond, school authorities ended up making the situation worse by suspending her.</p>
<p>If the Brooks family&#8217;s claims are accurate, then the school is essentially punishing Diamond for something she had no idea she was doing. It wouldn&#8217;t be hard to argue that instead of punishing her, the school district should have gone out of its way to help her recover from the incident.</p>
<p>All of this also raises questions about <a href="https://hightimes.com/culture/radical-rant-the-what-about-the-children-anti-marijuana-argument/">children and cannabis</a>. There has already been a lot of concern that edibles may end up <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/nevada-lawmaker-pushes-to-ban-edibles/">unintentionally attracting young kids</a>. This is a common concern among states with legal weed or those <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/legalization/states-pass-marijuana-laws-year/">considering legalization</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, anti-weed lawmakers often claim that legalization will cause dangerous increases in the number of teens consuming cannabis.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentC -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc article_middleContentC dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>But research does not support this idea. In fact, studies consistently find that when a state legalizes weed, the numbers of <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/teens-are-smoking-less-pot-following-legalization/">teens who consume cannabis</a> remain more or less the same. In some cases, the numbers actually show <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/teen-drug-use-colorado-since-weed-legalization/">slight decreases</a>.</p>

INSERT INTO articles VALUES (12546, 'Canada Seems Ready to Break Three International Treaties to Legalize Cannabis', NULL, 'trudeau-international-treaties-cannabis-act-1280x800.jpg', '<div class="uncode_text_column"><p>With the legalization of recreational cannabis just around the corner, Canadians are talking a lot about sales and distribution, impaired driving, and the impact on children&#8212;but little has been said about international law.<br>
</p>
<div id="leafly-dfp-ad-widget-mobile-medium-rectangle-352445232" class="leafly-dfp-ad-container">    </div>
<p>If all goes according to the plan laid out by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the Cannabis Act will place Canada in violation of three UN treaties. The Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961), the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971) and the Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988) all require countries to ban the possession and production of recreational cannabis.</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">Some legal experts believe Canada should abide by the terms of the treaties, even if it means delaying legalization.</div>
<p>To withdraw from the treaties, a country must give the UN notification a year in advance&#8212;so Ottawa would have had to give notice last July in order to withdraw from the treaties before July 2018, the date the Trudeau government has set for legalization of recreational cannabis.</p>
<p>Some legal experts believe Canada should abide by the terms of the treaties, even if it means delaying legalization to allow enough time for withdrawal, while others say that&#8217;s not necessary. But all agree the federal government needs to address this issue &#8212; something it hasn&#8217;t yet done.</p>
<p>Steven Hoffman, a professor in the Faculty of Health and Osgoode Hall Law School at York University in Toronto, is an advocate for the legalization of recreational cannabis, believing its criminalization has had negative legal and health consequences. He also believes the UN treaties are outdated and &#8220;not reflective of current science.&#8221; But he feels strongly that Canada shouldn&#8217;t violate them.</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">&#8220;If we undermine international law it takes away from our credibility as a country and (makes it) more difficult to criticize other countries for violating international law.&#8221;<div class="leafly-pull-quote-attribution">law professor Steven Hoffman</div></div>
<p>&#8220;International law is not an esoteric doctrine. It&#8217;s not faraway thing that only nerdy academics think about,&#8221; he told Leafly. &#8220;It governs international interaction at almost every level, from mailing holiday cards to the functioning of the internet. If we undermine international law it takes away from our credibility as a country&#8212;and it becomes politically more difficult to criticize other countries for violating international law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Canada should legalize recreational cannabis without violating international law, he said, which would require Ottawa to withdraw from the treaties then wait a year for legalization. He added that Canada could withdraw from the treaties and rejoin after legalization, declaring that it accepts the general concepts of the treaties except in their application to cannabis.</p>
<p>But Hoffman dismissed some other alternatives to withdrawal.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/canada/a-province-by-province-guide-to-canadian-cannabis-regulations"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/30113459/guide-to-provincial-regulations-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Canadian Cannabis Legalization: A Guide to Laws by Province</div></div></a></div>
<p>The treaties stipulate that countries aren&#8217;t required to implement provisions that violate their constitutions, so amending the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms to include a right to consume cannabis would solve the problem. But Hoffman feels the process of changing the charter would be arduous to the point of being untenable.</p>
<p>Under the rules of the treaties, cannabis could be made available for &#8220;scientific purposes.&#8221; The government could ramp up its funding of research projects, but that might not be enough to sway international bodies&#8212;the Trudeau government has never cited scientific research as its motivation for legalizing recreational cannabis.</p>
<p>John Walsh, director for drug policy at Washington Office on Latin America (an American NGO) and some other pundits have floated the idea of reaching a separate agreement on the cannabis issue with other like-minded countries that have signed the treaties. Hoffman acknowledges that the Vienna Convention allows for this, but says those agreements are intended to tighten treaty restrictions, not loosen them.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/canada/the-cannabis-acts-final-hurdle-a-contentious-senate"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/09104734/canadian-senate-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">The Canadian Cannabis Act&#8217;s Final Hurdle: A Contentious Senate</div></div></a></div>
<p>Walsh and others also say Canada could remain a signatory to the treaties while publicly acknowledging that its legalization of recreational cannabis will result in a period of &#8220;respectful non-compliance&#8221; with some treaty obligations. They say this approach would display the appropriate regard for international law. Respectful or not, this approach is a violation of international law and not advisable, says Hoffman.</p>
<h2><strong>&#8216;No Need for Hasty Decisions&#8217;</strong></h2>
<p>Ultimately, the consequences of violating the treaties are not dire, according to Walsh and four other political pundits who collaborated on an opinion piece for the website <a href="https://ipolitics.ca/2017/12/11/yes-legalizing-marijuana-breaks-treaties-not-problem/">ipolitics</a>. They point out that Uruguay, the first country to regulate cannabis, has violated international drug laws and has suffered nothing more than a mention in the annual reports of an organization that monitors the implementation of UN drug conventions. The US states that have legalized recreational cannabis have had a similar experience.</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">The Trudeau government certainly doesn&#8217;t seem to be in a rush to address the matter. It has said next to nothing about it.</div>
<p>&#8220;The bottom line is that Canada ultimately will need to choose a path forward with regard to cannabis regulation and the drug treaties,&#8221; Walsh and the others wrote. &#8220;But there is no need for hasty decisions and plenty of time for Canada to evaluate its options&#8212;and act when the time is ripe.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Trudeau government certainly doesn&#8217;t seem to be in a rush to address the matter. It has said next to nothing about it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, opposition politicians are demanding action. &#8220;The government has a position to legalize [cannabis] which contravenes the terms of those three treaties and so the government should be upfront and respect the signatories to the treaty and withdraw,&#8221; Conservative foreign affairs critic Peter Kent said in June. &#8220;We would condemn the government allowing Canada to go into violation of the treaties.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/canada/cannabis-act-senate-watch-a-resolved-stalemate-creates-a-new-sale-date"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/15133120/canadian-senate-roundup-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Cannabis Act Senate Watch: A Resolved Stalemate Creates a New Sale Date</div></div></a></div>
<p>&#8220;The bottom line is, we believe Canada &#8230; should be principled with all of its dealings with the international organizations with which we have treaties and agreements,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Hoffman shares that view. &#8220;We are increasingly depending on international law,&#8221; he told Leafly. &#8220;It&#8217;s weak, but it&#8217;s the strongest one we have.&#8221;</p>

PAUL, Minn. (<em>AP</em>) &#8212; Minnesota health officials say many medical marijuana users report significant reductions in pain.</p>
<p>More than 60 percent of the more than 2,200 patients surveyed by the state report benefits from using marijuana in inhaled or pill forms during the first five months after Minnesota approved cannabis to treat pain. The survey also found that 43 percent of doctors observed medical marijuana having a positive effect on patients.</p>
<p>The report surveyed patients who used cannabis in 2016 for the first time to treat chronic pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s heartening to see that this fairly large proportion achieved that degree of reduction in their pain assessment score,&#8221; said Dr. Tom Arneson, research manager for the office of medical cannabis.</p>
<p>More than 350 patients involved in the study initially reported using opioid painkillers. Nearly 63 percent reported reduced or eliminated opioid usage after six months of using medical cannabis.</p>
<p>There were no reports of cannabis use that was life-threatening or required hospitalization.</p>
<p>Officials believe the results are encouraging, but say more research is necessary. A controlled study that includes giving some participants a placebo is needed, Arneson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need more research into the potential value of medical cannabis in pain management, especially as our communities grapple with the harmful impacts of opioids and other medications now in use for that purpose,&#8221; Arneson said.</p>
<p>About 10 percent of patients reported no benefit, while as much as 40 percent experienced mild side effects such as fogginess or fatigue. At least one patient found that the positive effects of cannabis were only temporary.</p>

<p>New York City has tried to reduce the penalties for getting caught with weed. Despite this, there remain some troubling trends in how the city enforces <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> laws. With the NYPD facing criticism for racial disparity in marijuana arrests, city policymakers are returning to important conversations about race, cannabis, and law enforcement.</p>
<h2>Council Members Call Out NYPD</h2>
<p>In 2013, NYC Mayor de Blasio ordered a change to the way NYPD enforced weed laws. Under the order, cops are supposed to give a summons to the huge majority of people caught with weed instead of arresting them.</p>
<p>Since then, the city has seen a 40 percent drop in marijuana arrests. But there are still some obvious problems</p>
<p>At a hearing earlier today, City Council members criticized the NYPD for huge racial disparities in marijuana arrests. According to <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nypd-fire-massive-racial-gap-city-marijuana-arrest-article-1.3842903" rel="nofollow">New York Daily News</a>, there were roughly 17,500 arrests last year for marijuana possession. A full 86 percent of those arrested were black and Latinx.</p>
<p>&#8220;The racial disparities have not changed one bit, and arrests are still too common in communities of color,&#8221; said Councilman Donovan Richards. &#8220;If the administration is serious about changing this disparity, we&#8217;re not seeing it.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>NYPD officials acknowledged that the stats do point to racial inequities. But they also said that officers were not doing anything wrong. Instead, NYPD authorities said that cops were simply responding to the neighborhoods where they get the most complaints.</p>
<p>&#8220;Where the arrests are made, I believe, are where the complaints are,&#8221; said Dermot Shea, NYPD&#8217;s chief of crime control strategies.</p>
<p>But that explanation did not satisfy many Council Members. In fact, several of them pushed the NYPD on the issue. Ultimately, NYPD representatives were unable to produce any statistics backing up their claim.</p>
<p>&#8220;I refuse to believe that in New York City, a city of eight and a half million, that the only individuals calling 911 or 311 on this issue are people in communities in color,&#8221; said Richards. &#8220;You can walk around City Hall these days, and walk through the park and you will smell marijuana being burned.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>Final Hit: NYPD Facing Criticism For Racial Disparity in Marijuana Arrests</h2>
<p>The ongoing racial disparities in how the NYPD enforces weed laws are in line with national trends. Unfortunately, these trends have existed for decades. In fact, the ACLU published a comprehensive <a href="https://www.aclu.org/report/report-war-marijuana-black-and-white?redirect=criminal-law-reform/war-marijuana-black-and-white" rel="nofollow">report</a> on the subject a few years ago.</p>
<p>The organization found that white and black people consume cannabis at more or less the same levels. Despite this, black people are 3.73 times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than white people.</p>
<p>Those numbers represent national trends. At the state level, the picture gets even worse. There are at least 15 states where the racial disparities are worse than the national average.</p>
<p>Fortunately, some lawmakers are trying to address these trends. Most recently, a group of Congresspeople introduced the <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/marijuana-justice-act-critical/">Marijuana Justice Act</a> to the House of Representatives. The bill is the House version of a similar bill introduced to the Senate last fall by New Jersey Senator <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/cory-booker-finds-co-sponsor-marijuana-legalization-bill/">Cory Booker</a>.</p>
<p>The Marijuana Justice Bill calls for the legalization of cannabis at the federal level. But it also goes much further.</p>
<p>The bill proposes expunging all weed-related convictions from people&#8217;s records. Additionally, it proposes earmarking funds for educational programs.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

Sessions</em></a>, which challenged the federal government&#8217;s scheduling of cannabis, a federal judge on Monday dismissed the lawsuit.<br>
</p>
<div id="leafly-dfp-ad-widget-mobile-medium-rectangle-1774567448" class="leafly-dfp-ad-container">    </div>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">The medical cannabis patients must submit to the Justice Department''s rescheduling process before taking their claims to federal court, the judge ruled.</div>
<p>Medical cannabis patients Marvin Washington, Dean Bartell, Alexis Bartell, Jose Belen, Sebastien Cotte, and Jagger Cotte, along with the Cannabis Cultural Association, filed their lawsuit on July 24, 2017. Their complaint challenged the constitutionality of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), which places cannabis in Schedule I&#8212;the most restrictive level of drug classification.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein&#8217;s 20-page decision stated that the case turned not on <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/medical-cannabis-clearly-saves-lives-federal-judge-declares" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the merits of the plaintiffs&#8217; case</a> for the medical efficacy of cannabis but rather on procedural issues. As a point of law, he wrote, the plaintiffs were required to first argue their case through the administrative procedure set up to reconsider the placement of a drug on the federal schedule. This is known as the &#8220;exhaustion rule,&#8221; Hellerstein wrote, which requires &#8220;that parties exhaust prescribed administrative remedies before seeking relief from the federal courts.&#8221;</p>
<p>In other words, Hellerstein determined that the medical cannabis patients would have to petition the government before taking their claims to federal court. Past attempts by others to change marijuana&#8217;s status through the administrative process have taken years before ultimately failing.</p>

<h2>Yes, Cannabis Has Medical Benefits, but&#8230;</h2>
<p>The judge&#8217;s ruling acknowledged that cannabis does have current medical uses, but &#8220;I cannot say that Congress acted irrationally in placing marijuana in Schedule I&#8221; back in the early 1970s, he wrote.</p>
<p>&#8220;This decision,&#8221; he added, &#8220;should not be understood as a factual finding that marijuana lacks any medical use in the United States.</p>

<h2>Nixon&#8217;s Racist Motivations</h2>
<p>Hellerstein also rejected the plaintiffs&#8217; contention that the racial animus of President Richard Nixon contributed to the Schedule I status of cannabis. The Cannabis Cultural Association, a nonprofit group that focuses on advancing the business footprint of marginalized groups in the cannabis industry, had alleged that the Controlled Substances Act violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution because it was passed with racial animus.</p>
<p>While the CCC submitted evidence of President Richard Nixon&#8217;s racially motivated reasons for keeping marijuana highly illegal, Hellerstein ruled that Nixon&#8217;s racist motivations could not be attributed to Congressional lawmakers who drafted the CSA and ultimately determined the initial scheduling of cannabis.</p>
<h2>There May Be an Appeal</h2>
<p>Hellerstein&#8217;s ruling came as a disappointment to the plaintiffs.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">&#8220;Resigning the plaintiffs to the petitioning administrative process is tantamount to a death sentence for those patients who need cannabis to live,&#8221; said Michael Hiller, lead counsel for the plaintiffs. &#8220;The time has come for the courts to abandon decades-old precedent, notched with obsolete legal technicalities, and catch up with modern science and contemporary principles of constitutional law.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>Lauren Rudick, co-counsel for the cannabis patients, added: &#8220;T<span class="s1">he plaintiffs weren&#8217;t the only ones who experienced a setback today. States and principles of federalism took a black eye as well, and under the false premise that the courts are constrained by prior decisions to take actions, which the overwhelming majority of Americans, including members of Congress and the President, know are wrong.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&#8220;While this has been a disappointing setback in the battle to reschedule, great kudos are due to our litigation team of Joseph A. Bondy, Michael Hiller, Lauren Rudick, and Fatima Afia,&#8221; said attorney David Holland,&#160;<span class="s1">a member of the legal team representing plaintiffs in the suit.&#160;</span>&#8220;We were able to bring this battle into the mainstream conversation where the general public was able to identify with the suffering of many of these plaintiffs, and empathized with efforts to seek simple, safe, effective medical relief.&#8221;</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Added Hiller:&#160;</span><span class="s1">&#8220;This case will continue to move forward. Notwithstanding the outcome today, we remain confident that the final disposition of this case will include a finding that the classification of cannabis under the Controlled Substances Act is unconstitutional&#8212;freeing millions of Americans to safely treat their conditions with a plant that maintains their health and their lives.&#8221; </span></p>

														<div id="tps_slideContainer_181851" class="theiaPostSlider_slides"><div class="theiaPostSlider_preloadedSlide">

<p>With the passage of a bill on Tuesday, Indiana is one step closer to legalizing <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/cannabidiol-cbd/">CBD</a> oil. The Indiana House passed the measure, Senate Bill 52 (SB-52) by a unanimous vote of 93-0. If the bill becomes law, it would legalize CBD oil with low levels of <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/science/thc-tetrahydrocannabinol/">THC</a> in the Hoosier State. Before that happens, however, the bill will have to be finalized by lawmakers and signed by Governor Eric Holcomb.</p>
<h2>Senate Bill 52</h2>
<p>Earlier this month, the Indiana Senate passed the original bill, authored by Representative Michael Young, a Republican from Indianapolis. SB-52 was then referred to the House on February 6.</p>
<p>Once under consideration there, representatives added several amendments to the bill.</p>
<p>As first written, the bill only allowed &#8220;zero THC hemp extract&#8221; products. Lawmakers changed that requirement to make goods with a maximum of 0.3 percent THC legal.</p>
<p>The bill explicitly&#160;specifies that hemp extracts under 0.3 percent THC are not controlled substances under state law.&#160; Another amendment eliminates a state CBD registry that was begun to allow epilepsy patients to use treatments with the cannabinoid.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>The bill that created the registry caused widespread <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/cbd/indianas-cbd-mess-crackdown-one-day-apology-the-next/" rel="nofollow">confusion</a> in the state when it was passed last year.</p>
<p>The House also included protections for CBD users who fail workplace drug tests in its version.</p>
<p>Dr. Stuart Titus is the CEO of Medical <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">Marijuana</a> Inc., a company that sells CBD products under its brand <a href="https://www.medicalmarijuanainc.com/hempmeds/" rel="nofollow">HempMeds,</a> among others. He told<em> High Times&#160;</em>that those safeguards for workers are necessary.</p>
<p>&#8220;In Indiana, one can go to various health food stores and purchase hemp food products&#8212;hemp seed, hemp seed oil, and hemp protein powder&#8212;all with enough THC in them to where military personnel, government employees, or others who are drug tested may fail a drug screening. People use these hemp food products for their nutritional values and not to get high,&#8221; said Dr. Titus.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<h2>More Work To Do</h2>
<p>Next, the Senate and the House will have to reconcile differences in the bill passed by each body. The Senate could vote to concur or agree to the changes made by the House. But that does not appear likely based on statements made by the bill&#8217;s author.</p>
<p>&#8220;They changed the bill,&#8221; Young <a href="https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2018/02/27/cbd-oil-could-legalized-end-march-indiana/377848002/" rel="nofollow">said to the IndyStar</a>.&#160;&#8220;I&#8217;d rather get it back and look at it first. I&#8217;m just not going to concur. That&#8217;s all I can say right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>That means the legislation will most likely be headed to a conference committee. Lawmakers in both houses will then have the chance to iron out the differences they have. Chances of an agreement seem likely, according to Republican Rep. Bill Friend of Macy.</p>
<p>&#8220;My goal is to clear up the confusion about CBD oil and make it available to all people with some discomfort,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>Final Hit: Indiana Is One Step Closer to Legalizing CBD Oil</h2>
<p>Indiana may see even more CBD in its near future. Two more bills will also be voted on by the state Senate soon.</p>
<p>One of them, House Bill 1137, would establish an industrial hemp agriculture pilot program. That would allow Indiana farmers to legally grow hemp in the state.</p>

			<p>One arena in which the cannabis industry has struggled to make serious gains is the stock market.</p>
<p>Most plant-touching companies that are also publicly traded still live on the over-the-counter markets, dreaming of the day when they&#8217;ll graduate to the Nasdaq or the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>As the founder and CEO of California-based Terra Tech Corp. &#8211; one of the largest and most stable publicly traded plant-touching cannabis companies in the United States &#8211; Peterson&#8217;s ambitions for his business include getting to $100 million in revenue and then upgrading from over-the-counter markets to a major stock exchange.</p>
<p>Terra Tech has acquired 10 marijuana retail and cultivation permits in both California and neighboring Nevada since its founding in 2008, along with a burgeoning traditional produce business to help diversify its portfolio.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cannabisbenchmarks.com/annual-review-and-outlook-2017-2018-edition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-66014" src="https://mjbizdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1.png" alt="" width="300"></a>Over the past decade, Peterson has built the company into a solid force that went from roughly $7 million in revenue in 2014 to more than $25 million in 2016.</p>
<p>Though Terra Tech&#8217;s financials for 2017 haven&#8217;t been fully released yet, the company stands to do even better, with revenue of nearly $25 million for just the first three quarters of last year.</p>
<p><em>Marijuana Business Daily</em> caught up with Peterson to talk about marijuana banking issues, Terra Tech&#8217;s growth and how U.S. cannabis companies can compete with their Canadian counterparts.</p>
<p><strong>What are the biggest challenges in running a publicly traded plant-touching company?</strong></p>
<p>Banking. Because we&#8217;re publicly traded, we have quarterly reviews and annual audits.</p>
<p>And because we have to deal in cash at almost all of our locations in some capacity &#8230;&#160; we have no long-term banking solution generally in any market.</p>
<p>That adds a ton of time and complexity to the audit.</p>
<p>When you add time to the audit, it raises the risk of not meeting your filing deadline.&#160;When you add complexity to the audit, it raises the cost.</p>
<p>The cash handling &#8211; besides the security of it, the expense of it, the irritation of it &#8211; creates a very challenging and expensive environment to audit a public company.</p>
<p>Literally everything &#8211; every transaction that we make on the cultivation side or the retail side, every piece of product that passes through distribution to retail, every product movement &#8211; needs some sort of journal entry in our accounting.</p>
<p>Any one of those journal entries in the accounting could be subject to our audit review at the end of the year.</p>
<p>We have to do monthly cash counts, where auditors come out to our facilities and reconcile our cash on a monthly basis at our different locations.</p>
<p>It just ties into so many little nuanced areas of the company, from the reporting, from the 10-K filings, to the Q filings to different 8-K filings.</p>
<p><strong>Terra Tech&#8217;s revenue more than tripled from $7 million to $25 million between 2014 and 2016, and you were at nearly $25 million during the first nine months of 2017. What do you attribute that solid growth to?</strong></p>
<p>The main driver over the last year was the implementation of adult use in Nevada.</p>
<p>We hold the most permits in Nevada.&#160;We have four retail stores, large-scale cultivation, large-scale extraction, two additional stores that we have in partnership with NuLeaf by sharing a cultivation facility.</p>
<p>We also had some other acquisitions and some organic growth within California, and some growth on the (traditional) produce side.</p>
<p>This year, we&#8217;re spending more time on pushing our wholesale brand throughout California.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re lighting up a lot more cultivation and extraction space in the California marketplace.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re bringing online our large-scale cultivation and extraction facility in Nevada.</p>
<p>So, this year, we&#8217;re hoping that a lot of the organic growth will come from M&amp;A on the retail side and from organic growth of our manufacturing and wholesale brands.</p>
<p><strong>Which states or countries are you targeting for expansion?</strong></p>
<p>We were heavily focused on Nevada.</p>
<p><a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/chart-record-first-month-recreational-marijuana-sales-nevada/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Being in Nevada</a> was not only to take care of the tourism aspect, but you get macrobranding there because you get to expose your brand to people from Asia and Europe and everywhere.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a really interesting byproduct of doing business in Nevada.</p>
<p>California, the sixth-largest economy in the world, <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/4b-brave-new-world-updates-launch-californias-rec-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest cannabis market</a> &#8211; it&#8217;s a no-brainer to be here.</p>
<p>We were really avoiding all the other states.</p>
<p>In New Jersey, we have a farm&#160;where we grow Edible Gardens produce.</p>
<p>And new Gov. (Phil) Murphy is now <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/new-jersey-governor-seeks-review-medical-marijuana-program/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanding medical</a> and <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/marijuana-entrepreneurs-already-lining-new-jerseys-impending-recreational-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fast-tracking adult use</a> at some point this year, so by default we&#8217;re going to go to Jersey.</p>
<p>We want to execute in those three states and grab as much market share as we can with our brands.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think Terra Tech may have to do to compete long term on an international scale, given that Canadian companies are expanding their footprints so quickly and taking the lead globally?</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s access to capital. Real institutional support will change that paradigm drastically.</p>
<p>true access to Wall Street capital markets, not just the smaller hedge funds and the family offices, but real institutional access will change the paradigm for a lot of players in the United States.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where the industry really grows.</p>
<p><strong>Is Congress going to have to act in some way before that happens?</strong></p>
<p>I think so, but I don&#8217;t think we need to see federal legalization.</p>
<p>What it may be is just some fixed piece of law that looks a lot like the <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/federal-medical-cannabis-protection-extended/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rohrabacher-Blumenauer Amendment</a>, which is, hands-off, states&#8217; rights and so on.</p>
<p>That is probably enough to open up access to the capital markets, the institutional capital, the large broker dealers and the investment banks.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think we need sweeping federal legalization, but we need something codified in law that says, &#8220;Hands-off the states when it pertains to this.&#8221;</p>

<p>In addition to positions aimed at speeding the licensing process in general, Cat Packer, the department&#8217;s executive director, told Leafly that she intends to hire a social equity program manager to help spur the initiative forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no secret that with more resources you can get more done,&#8221; Packer said.</p>
<p>In addition to the new positions, which include accounting and administrative clerks, management assistants, and public relations personnel, the City Council approved hiring new staff at the Office of Finance, City Attorney&#8217;s Office, and the Los Angeles Fire Department, agencies the city&#8217;s cannabis department regularly collaborates with, Packer said.</p>

<p>The new cannabis jobs still need to be approved by the mayor&#8217;s office and the city administrative officer. The mayor has until March 12 to act.

<p>More than <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/california-goes-legal-these-stores-cities-are-set-to-open-jan-1-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">120 retail cannabis businesses</a> so far have received city approval for licenses. Officials have said they estimate hundreds of unlicensed businesses are also operating, albeit illegally.</p>
<p>Some in the industry are hopeful that new Department of Cannabis Regulation staff will increase the office&#8217;s capacity, bringing regulatory progress on all fronts. But in terms of the city&#8217;s social equity program, intended to address disproportionate drug-war harm inflicted on minority communities, complicated questions remain.</p>
<h2>Equity Program Still Taking Shape</h2>
<p>One key component of the program that still needs to be finalized: Who qualifies for it?</p>
<p>The answer will be determined in part by a coded map of the city that identifies which neighborhoods were particularly hard hit by the war on drugs. Assembled with the help of an outside consultant, these communities were identified through a variety of factors, including marijuana-related arrest rates and the number of people living in poverty.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/oakland-rolls-drug-war-reparations"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/27161342/oakland-drug-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Oakland Rolls Out Drug War Reparations</div></div></a></div>
<p>The city&#8217;s initial survey highlighted a number of applicable areas. But councilmembers called for further study after noticing that one region of the city, the San Fernando Valley, seemed to contain none.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the strongest impacts of the war on drugs were probably felt other places, there were impacts in the Valley as well,&#8221; said Jake Flynn, the communications director for Blumenfield, whose district is located in the San Fernando Valley. &#8220;And we felt that wasn&#8217;t really addressed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The San Fernando Valley is a massive swath of LA that&#8217;s home to approximately 40% of the city&#8217;s population. The city is sending its consultant back to the drawing board, to review additional data and contributing factors to &#8220;expand the social equity analysis to include the San Fernando Valley,&#8221; according to council files.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/california-is-still-arresting-too-many-people-of-color-for-cannabis"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/21145158/cannabis-poc-arrests-california-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">California Is Still Arresting Too Many People of Color for Cannabis</div></div></a></div>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t believe this will cause additional delay, and our understanding is that license processing and program implementation continue to move forward while the Council studies whether to fine-tune elements of the existing framework,&#8221; Clark, the cannabis attorney, said in an email.</p>
<p>Robert Chlala, a policy researcher for UFCW Local 770 and a member of the social equity working group for the advocacy group LA Cannabis Task Force, said there is some upside to the slow progress of the social equity program. Namely, applicants have more time to prepare and hammer out potential roadblocks.</p>
<p>Among the obstacles is the fact that applicants need to have secured a location for their business before applying for a license. That can be difficult for equity program applicants, who may have limited access to property or investment capital. Even once after obtaining appropriately zoned location, it can be prohibitively expensive to pay rent on that dormant property while waiting for license approval.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/former-congressional-aide-convicted-of-taking-cannabis-bribe"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/02121801/iStock-534102839-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Former Congressional Aide Convicted of Taking Cannabis Bribe</div></div></a></div>
<p>Advocacy groups, meanwhile, have been working to line up support systems for eligible applicants. The California Minority Alliance has been working to partner potential equity applicants with qualified private investors, for example, and Chairman Donnie Anderson says the organization has vetted 20 licensees and already helped some secure funding.</p>
<p>While the City Council has approved the new cannabis positions through June, Clark predicted the funding would be extended going forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would expect the Mayor to propose similar resources in his budget for the next fiscal year,&#8221; she said via email, &#8220;but that is something we will pay close attention to during budget season.&#8221;</p>

<p>Natural State Wellness Enterprises had its choice of either Jackson or Jefferson counties because two of its applications were <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/02/28/arkansas-5-companies-grow-medical-marijuana/100155/">chosen by the state among the top five</a>.

<p>Calhoun said Monday that the decision was based partly on the county&#8217;s location, which can give the cultivation center a greater ability to supply dispensaries in other regions of the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;Jefferson County is centrally located,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Clients looked at the economics of Jefferson County, and it seemed to be a great fit.&#8221;</p>
<p>Calhoun also acknowledged that county officials offered economic incentives to choose Pine Bluff over Newport, but said he&#8217;s uncertain what such incentives would be.</p>
<p>Natural State Wellness is the second cultivation facility to be approved for establishment in Jefferson County, joining Natural State Medicinals Cultivation.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think this is another step in Pine Bluff&#8217;s economic resurgence,&#8221; said Caleb McMahon, director of economic development for the Pine Bluff Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Natural State Wellness is now working to get a $500,000 performance bond and to pay the $100,000 license fee to the Medical Marijuana Commission with hopes of starting construction soon.</p>

<p>Murphy&#8217;s inauguration raised the expectations of many cannabis advocates to new heights. The Democrat <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/new-jerseys-primary-huge-win-legalization-heres" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaigned hard on marijuana reform</a>.

<p>Those 100 days expire on April 26, 2018, and it&#8217;s looking like cannabis advocates may have raised their expectations a little too high. Because something predictable happened on the way to Trenton: Opposition hardened, the Democrats splintered, the GOP went backwards, and the short-term odds for legalization dimmed.</p>
<p>&#8220;With control of three branches of government and a sentiment towards progressive policies, it would seem difficult to mess up marijuana in New Jersey,&#8221; Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop told Leafly. &#8220;But rest assured&#8212;Trenton will find a way.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the state&#8217;s long-languishing medical cannabis program will probably see some much-needed improvements, Fulop may be right about adult-use legalization. Less than two months into Phil Murphy&#8217;s term as governor, it&#8217;s looking like cannabis prohibition isn&#8217;t going to disappear anytime soon.</p>

<p>On Monday, the Assembly&#8217;s Oversight Committee heard from experts on cannabis legalization, the first action taken in the Assembly on marijuana since new Democratic Speaker Craig Coughlin took over leadership of the chamber this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to let the committee do its work and I&#8217;m going to look at what they&#8217;ve done,&#8221; Coughlin told the Associated Press prior to the hearing. &#8220;Certainly on my own I&#8217;ll start to look at the issue and do what we can to get it right.&#8221;</p>
<p>Yesterday&#8217;s hearing came as Gov. Murphy is drafting his first budget, which he will unveil later this month, and as he tries to make good on promises to ramp up education and pension spending. Murphy has estimated that marijuana legalization could bring in roughly $300 million in revenue for the state. That&#8217;s just a fraction of what he would need to finance his proposals, though the governor cautions that he won&#8217;t fulfill his pledges &#8220;overnight.&#8221;</p>

<p>Legalizing cannabis legislatively within 100 days of taking office was an ambitious goal to begin with. It was a catchy soundbite that allowed Murphy to contrast his policies and values with Christie, then a wildly unpopular lame duck governor. Murphy&#8217;s opponent in the general election, Lt. Gov. Kim Guadagno, who was seen as a prot&#233;g&#233; of Christie&#8217;s.</p>
<p>One influential Democratic lawmaker, Sen. Nicholas Scutari, who chairs the Judiciary Committee, introduced legislation for legalization soon after Murphy took office.</p>
<p>The legislation is identical to a measure introduced in the previous session that legalizes the recreational use of marijuana for those at least 21. It permits possession of up to 1 ounce of marijuana, 16 ounces of marijuana-infused products in solids, 72 ounces in liquid form, 7 grams of concentrate and up to six immature plants.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/new-jersey-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-legalize-cannabis"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/12112227/new-jersey-adult-use-bill-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">New Jersey Lawmakers Introduce Bill to Legalize Cannabis</div></div></a></div>
<p>The legislation would establish a Division of Marijuana Enforcement, charged with regulating the industry. The legislation also would establish a sales tax on marijuana that would rise incrementally from 7% to 25% over five years to encourage early participation, Scutari said.</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">&#8220;Decriminalization does not achieve the racial and social justice goals that our legislators and Gov. Murphy have expressed.&#8221;<div class="leafly-pull-quote-attribution">Dianna Houenou, ACLU of New Jersey</div></div>
<p>Scutari&#8217;s bill hasn&#8217;t received the fast-track reception Scutari and others hoped for, though. And it&#8217;s the party in power&#8212;the Democrats&#8212;who seem to be the main obstacle.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an open secret that Trenton&#8217;s top legislator, Senate President Steve Sweeney, is gunning for Murphy&#8217;s seat in 2021&#8212;even though they&#8217;re both Democrats. The tension between Murphy and Sweeney (who had a famously close relationship with Christie) is real. Sweeney has said he supports Murphy on legalization. But the growing friction between the two Trenton powerbrokers complicates everything.</p>
<p>Then there was a mini-mutiny within Murphy&#8217;s own party over the wisdom of legalization itself. Some Democrats are currently weighing their options. &#8220;I&#8217;m still researching it,&#8221; said Democratic Assemblywoman Annette Quijano (D-Elizabeth), who is widely seen as leaning in favor of legalization. State Sen. Bob Gordon, a Democrat, said he&#8217;s a no, for now. Republicans look reluctant to get on board. Senate Republican Leader Tom Kean Jr. is opposed.</p>
<p>The strongest backlash to Murphy&#8217;s legalization policy came from a handful of African-American legislators led by state Sen. Ron Rice, Sr., of Newark.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/this-one-chart-captures-everything-wrong-with-nyc-cannabis-arrest"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/23202131/this-one-chart-captures-everything-wrong-with-nyc-cannabis-arrest-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">This One Chart Captures Everything Wrong With NYC Cannabis Arrests</div></div></a></div>
<p>Rice allied himself with a group called&#160;<a href="http://nj-ramp.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RAMP-NJ</a>, which is closely aligned with Kevin Sabet&#8217;s SAM school of reefer madness. They&#8217;ve got a glossy new website and a blue-chip spokesperson named Jeanette Hoffman, a seasoned Trenton lobbyist and public relations pro who owns her own firm, Marathon Public Affairs. (Hoffman declined to respond to Leafly&#8217;s requests for comment about RAMP-NJ.)</p>
<p>The public&#8217;s view of legalization seems mixed. A February Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll showed 42% favor legalization, while roughly equal percentages of people backed either the status quo or only decriminalization. That poll surveyed 801 New Jersey residents and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 points.</p>

<p></p>
<p>A September 2017 Quinnipiac University poll showed that 59% of residents approved of marijuana legalization. The poll surveyed 1,121 voters and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 points.</p>
<p>Sen Rice, who has historically voted against all cannabis-related reform bills, is now pushing a sort of marijuana decriminalization bill (<a href="http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2018/Bills/S2000/1926_I1.HTM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">S1926</a>) that &#8220;requires substance abuse treatment under certain circumstances&#8221; and includes hefty civil fines up to $500.</p>
<p>Proponents of adult-use legalization see the decrim bill largely as a device meant to derail the movement toward fully regulated legalization.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/new-jersey-bill-would-dial-back-governors-legalization-promise"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/15143305/new-jersey-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">New Jersey Bill Would Dial Back Governor&#8217;s Legalization Promise</div></div></a></div>
<p>&#8220;Decriminalization does not achieve the racial and social justice goals that our legislators and Governor Murphy have expressed,&#8221; Dianna Houenou told Leafly. Houenou is policy counsel for the ACLU of New Jersey. &#8220;It still leads to arrests if people can&#8217;t pay fines,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It does nothing to take marijuana off the street or prevent access to children. And it does nothing to create jobs or generate revenue to pay for much-needed community programs. We can achieve these goals with a well-constructed legalization bill that keeps racial and social justice at its core.&#8221;</p>
<p>Assemblywoman Quijano chairs the powerful Assembly Judiciary Committee, a perch she uses to emphasize the social justice side of this debate. That&#8217;s why she&#8217;s drafting an expungement bill to nullify cannabis convictions &#8220;as soon as&#8221; cannabis is either decriminalized or legalized.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no number associated with this bill as it&#8217;s not yet posted. But Leafly got a sneak peek.<em> [Ed. note: A draft version of the bill is embedded at the end of this story.]</em></p>
<p>&#8220;Expungement will be granted immediately,&#8221; Quijano&#8217;s office told Leafly via email.&#160; &#8220;In addition to marijuana possession offenses, persons who have been charged with using marijuana concentrate or marijuana infused products may also apply for expungement. Current statutes do not speak to these two products.&#8221;</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s Next?</h2>
<p>Bill Caruso is a Trenton super-lobbyist. He&#8217;s very pro-legalization.</p>
<p>Caruso noted the shifting landscape that led many Garden State lawmakers to reconsider their prior positions on cannabis. The anti-cannabis side has conceded so much ground that they&#8217;re now fighting <em>for</em> decrim and expanded medical access.</p>
<p>&#8220;The silver lining is there&#8217;s new support for decriminalization that wasn&#8217;t there before,&#8221; Caruso told Leafly. &#8220;But also efforts like medical marijuana expansion which Senator Rice previously opposed. This represents a sea change in opinion towards marijuana reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>Caruso is eyeing Gov. Murphy&#8217;s upcoming March 13th budget address for clues about what&#8217;s next. Budgets reflect priorities, and &#8220;if cannabis doesn&#8217;t come up in Murphy&#8217;s budget address, that&#8217;s a bad sign&#8221; for legalization&#8217;s prospects this year.</p>

<h2>What About Medical Cannabis?</h2>
<p>New Jersey&#8217;s medical marijuana program, which went live under Chris Christie, suffered from Christie&#8217;s malign neglect during his tenure. But there&#8217;s legislation in the works to fix it. And, finally, a supportive governor.</p>
<p>&#8220;Governor Murphy is committed to expanding the New Jersey Medicinal Marijuana Program and to making the program more responsive to patients, physicians and dispensaries,&#8221; State Department of Health Spokesperson Donna Leusner told Leafly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Governor Murphy signed Executive Order 6 on Jan. 23 directing the Department of Health to conduct a review and issue a report within 60 days on all aspects of the Medicinal Marijuana Program. A report recommending changes is due to the Governor on March 24. The report will include an evaluation of the current program with a focus on regulatory, statutory and other changes that will remove obstructions to expansion.&#8221;</p>
<p>Assemblyman Reed Gusciora (D-Trenton) is eagerly awaiting the department&#8217;s findings and recommendation. He&#8217;s the prime co-sponsor of A3437, a bill that would directly address perennial concerns like price and accessibility for patients. The bill considers the needs of sick people who are forced to navigate the bureaucratic hurdles put in place by Chris Christie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s lessen that burden,&#8221; Gusciora told Leafly. &#8220;Let&#8217;s start there.&#8221;</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/industry/what-makes-a-state-medical-cannabis-program-succeed"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/17112620/what-makes-the-medical-marijuana-market-so-successful-1-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">What Makes a Medical Cannabis Program Succeed?</div></div></a></div>
<p>Gusciora&#8217;s legislation would end the arduous practice of recertifying chronic conditions to stay in compliance with state law. That ongoing level of over-regulation, a vestige of the Christie era, forces patients to recertify their qualifying condition every 90 days.</p>
<p>&#8220;No one with MS or HIV should ever have to recertify their condition,&#8221; Gusciora said. &#8220;That&#8217;s an insult to sick people.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gusciora&#8217;s bill also slashed NJ&#8217;s registration fee from $200 to $50. That eye-popping $200 pricetag is another piece of Christie&#8217;s anti-cannabis legacy.</p>
<p>Assemblyman Gusciora&#8217;s bill also triples the number of medical dispensaries allowed in New Jersey, while pegging future licensing directly to the growth of the state&#8217;s patient registry.</p>
<p>State law currently allows only six medical cannabis dispensaries statewide, an astonishing number given New Jersey&#8217;s population of nearly 9 million. Only 5 dispensaries are currently serving patients. To provide some scale, Arizona, with 7 million residents, has about 110 dispensaries serving patients around the state.</p>

<p>Gusciora told Leafly he timed this bill so that when Gov Murphy&#8217;s Health Department releases their findings, there&#8217;s good legislation already in the pipeline.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve reached out to Governor Murphy and are in constant contact,&#8221; Gusciora added. &#8220;Early indications are that&#8217;s where the Governor is headed and we want to meet him there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Assemblyman Tim Eustace (D-Maywood) co-sponsored Gusciora&#8217;s bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can move medical marijuana legislation early on while the new governor enjoins the fight for full legalization,&#8221; Eustace told Leafly &#8220;Let&#8217;s remove these extra doctor visits. Let&#8217;s expand the products available. And most of all let&#8217;s get more dispensaries online. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s prompted this flurry of bills addressing New Jersey&#8217;s broken medical marijuana program.&#8221;</p>

<p>The United Kingdom seems to be hypocritical with respect to its <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a> policy. The same government that claims cannabis has no medicinal function is now the leading medical marijuana exporter on the planet. This discrepancy has drug reform groups searching for answers. They are trying to understand why this country bans cannabis while exporting the most in the world.</p>
<h2><strong>UK Leads the World in Cannabis Export</strong></h2>
<p>Last year, the United Kingdom produced 95 tons of legal cannabis, according to a <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/uk-is-worlds-largest-producer-of-legal-cannabis-11278131" rel="nofollow">report</a> from the United Nations&#8217; International Narcotics Control Board.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the data shows that the United Kingdom dominated in cannabis exports&#8212;accounting for nearly 45 percent of the action. Its closest competitor is Canada. That country is responsible for 81 tons of cannabis.</p>
<p>In addition, the report shows two tons of cannabis was exported from the United Kingdom. That amounts to 68 percent of the world total. Coming in at second place was the Netherlands, with 16.4 percent.</p>
<h2><strong>Cannabis Advocates Are Miffed</strong></h2>
<p>Cannabis advocates have criticized the government of the United Kingdom for the double standard. They argue it has &#8220;consistently refused to allow medical cannabis&#8221; on the &#8220;basis that it has &#8216;no therapeutic value''&#8221;. They are especially incensed that this is going on when children like <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/uk-parliament-allow-six-year-old-medical-marijuana/">Alfie Dingley</a> are denied life-saving cannabis medication in their home country.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is scandalous and untenable for the UK government to maintain that cannabis has no medical uses, at the same time as licensing the world&#8217;s biggest government-approved medical cannabis production and export market,&#8221; said Steve Rolles, senior political analyst for Transform.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>&#8220;Countries with proper access to medical cannabis do not have this problem,&#8221; he added.</p>
<h2><strong>Big Pharma Is to Blame</strong></h2>
<p>A large part of the UK&#8217;s cannabis production goes to supply <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/gw-pharmaceuticals-files-for-fda-approval-after-report-confirms-success-in-treating-epilepsy/">GW Pharmaceuticals</a>. The company has been working for years to bring cannabis-based medicine&#160;to the U.S. market.</p>
<p>It already produces cannabis drugs for other countries. It is available by prescription.</p>
<p>The word on the street is that GW Pharma will soon market its epilepsy drug Epidiolex to patients in America.</p>
<p>In fact, the&#160;FDA recently gave the drug the green light.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

			</div>
		</div>

<h2><strong>Final Hit: This Country Bans Cannabis While Exporting The Most In The World</strong></h2>
<p>An estimated 1 million people in the United Kingdom are buying medical marijuana from the black market. This does not sit well with Rolles.</p>
<p>He finds the government&#8217;s actions &#8220;profoundly unethical.&#8221;</p>
<p>Furthermore, he says preventing patients from cannabis medicine is a&#160;&#8220;violation of the fundamental right to health.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The government must relax restrictions that grant a monopoly for a single product to a single company. It must allow access to cannabis-based medicines that serve patients need&#8212;what they don&#8217;t need is the government&#8217;s cruel and misguided war on people who use drugs,&#8221; he <a href="https://www.rt.com/uk/420569-cannabis-drug-weed-export/" rel="nofollow">said</a>.</p>

											    	<p>I get Mary&#8217;s voicemail. Again. Her name isn&#8217;t actually Mary, but that&#8217;s beside the point. I&#8217;m standing outside her office building, Amazon&#8217;s Day One South superstructure, located in Seattle&#8217;s depressingly concrete South Lake Union. It&#8217;s now called the Invictus building, but when I worked there it was Day One South. Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world as of this writing, supposedly has an office in Day One North (now known as the Cricket building) just across the courtyard. One time I saw him in the little plaza separating the two buildings, walking briskly to a silver car so fancy I couldn&#8217;t even tell what brand it was. I was tempted to ask him for twenty bucks, just to see his reaction. I didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Anyway. I&#8217;m standing outside my old office, Day One South, or Invictus, or whatever the hell it&#8217;s supposed to be called, waiting for Her-Name-Isn&#8217;t-Actually-Mary. We agreed to meet for happy hour. It&#8217;s so far past the time we&#8217;d agreed to meet I know she&#8217;s ghosting me. I ring her one last time. Voicemail. Again. I start to trudge home. Over a lunch break back when we were coworkers, Mary disclosed to me that she hated her job. She was a regular, full-time employee; I was a contract worker. I asked why she didn&#8217;t start looking for something else&#8212;she was bright, had good experience. &#8220;I can&#8217;t afford to,&#8221; she admitted. I thought she simply meant the salary was too lucrative to give up, but it wasn&#8217;t until later I realized what she was referring to. Mary was from China, here in the United States on a H1-B visa.</p>

<p>Amazon, started in 1994, is home to over 500,000 employees worldwide. In its South Lake Union headquarters alone there are around 40,000 employees&#8212;a staggering jump from just 5,000 in 2010. There have been many stories about Amazon&#8217;s infamous work culture&#8212;how it breaks people, how it&#8217;s sink-or-swim, the rampant sexism (which was so overwhelming when I worked there, it almost became comical&#8230;almost), the incompetent managers who knew nothing about their teams but made staggering amounts of money. We&#8217;ve all read the expos&#233;s. What we often don&#8217;t hear about, however, is how Amazon ropes people&#8212;specifically, foreign workers&#8212;into their web, making it nearly impossible to leave.</p>
<p>I rang up an old friend&#8212;who still works at Amazon, and, unlike Mary, returns my calls&#8212;who had his own theories about how the company exploits workers from other countries. Let&#8217;s call him Charlie. He&#8217;s worked at Amazon for nearly ten years in various roles, never making less than six figures, and has no plans on leaving the company any time soon. Charlie works on a team with mostly foreign coworkers, the majority from India and China, but a few from Australia and Europe as well. &#8220;H-1B is their visa program,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;Theoretically, an employer must pay [foreign workers] the same as [American workers] and prove there isn&#8217;t an American candidate more qualified for the role under this visa. My guess is that the foreign worker is paid the same as an American, but it&#8217;s all about control&#8212;foreign workers can&#8217;t leave their jobs as easily as their American counterparts.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all about control &#8211; foreign workers can&#8217;t leave their jobs as easily as their American counterparts.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>&#8220;There are two general theories about H-1B,&#8221; he continued, specifically referencing H-1B visas for roles that involve software coding. &#8220;One, that programming is really hard and there aren&#8217;t enough people in the world to do it well, let alone in the U.S. Two, that it&#8217;s some weird indentured servitude thing to suppress wages and unionization since people on visas will be terrified of doing anything that could lose their visa. I think it&#8217;s a bit of both.&#8221; To make matters more interesting, when regular, full-time employees sign on with the company, they&#8217;re awarded a hefty signing bonus. &#8220;When I signed on,&#8221; he disclosed, &#8220;I got 20k&#8212;half when I started, half a year later. This has doubled now, from what I hear.&#8221; If a H-1B holder wanted to leave Amazon for a competitor, or quit due to job dissatisfaction, their signing bonus must be paid back&#8212;a hefty sum for someone new to the country, especially if the money has already been spent.</p>
<p>The main criticism behind H-1B is the clear monetary preference for employers to hire foreign workers over American ones, but for me this isn&#8217;t about Americans losing out on opportunities. Rather, this is a call to examine the preference to hire foreign employees who just so happen to have extremely sticky contracts surrounding their employment, not to mention little incentive to speak up against mistreatment. Amazon is already notorious for pushing workers to the brink; purposefully hiring workers who will be less likely to complain seems perilously convenient.</p>

<p>According to myvisajobs.com, &#8220;Amazon Corporate Llc has filed 6395 labor condition applications for H1B visa and 3076 labor certifications for green card from fiscal year 2014 to 2016,&#8221; with the highest number of applicants hailing from India and China, followed by Canada, Australia, Mexico, Russia, Ukraine, Israel, South Korea and Turkey. &#8220;When an employee renews or transfers his H1B visa or changes work location under some circumstances, he will also file a new LCA application,&#8221; states the website. As there are only 85,000 slots for applications a year, refiling for a new application when you&#8217;ve already received your visa is an enormous gamble. Staying in your current role is the only option for most, particularly when visas are awarded via a lottery system due to enormous demand.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not surprised Mary didn&#8217;t get back to me. It&#8217;s risky to speak ill of the Amazon monolith, even under anonymity. Hell, I&#8217;m writing this piece anonymously. Who dares go against Amazon? Not me, certainly. And as they destroy more small businesses, as well as completely reshape retail and what we expect from online shopping companies, how can we protect workers who fall into their visa trap? Is it even possible? As much as I dislike Amazon, there&#8217;s a part of me that always wonders: Will I have to go back one day? Will it be my only option in a world where Amazon has destroyed so many industries, and I have no other options? So for now, I&#8217;m Anonymous. Sorry. I might need to trudge back to Day One South again one day.</p>

<p>The city&#8217;s <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2016/11/14/initiative-300-social-pot-use-denver/67596/">Cannabis Consumption Establishment</a> allows adults to consume legal quantities of marijuana by vaping, dabbing or consuming edible products inside the venue. The shop doesn&#8217;t allow smoking, which is only permitted outdoors.</p>
<p>While private &#8220;consumption clubs&#8221; also have popped up recently in other parts of Colorado and Massachusetts, representatives from the Clark County Commission and Las Vegas City Council said valley jurisdictions will take a wait-and-see approach instead of <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/12/15/las-vegas-marijuana-lounges/94730/">joining in immediately</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need to figure out what impact these lounges will have on our community,&#8221; County Commissioner Chris Giunchigliani said. &#8220;We want to use Denver as a threshold to monitor what happens.&#8221;</p>
<p>Denver&#8217;s Tetra 9 Lounge opened a nonlicensed pot club charging monthly membership fees for those who wish to enter and consume the plant. <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/02/24/massachusetts-marijuana-club-worcester/99894/">The Summit Lounge</a>, based in Worcester, Mass., did the same early last month.</p>

<hr>
<p>Officials from both states have questioned the legality of the membership-only model, saying it operates in a gray area. Those clubs don&#8217;t sell marijuana; you have to bring your own to consume.</p>
<p>The Clark County Commission in September heard arguments from the Clark County Green Ribbon Panel to allow such lounges in the valley but decided to table its decision to early this year. While commissioners have not addressed pot lounges since, Commission Chairman Steve Sisolak has said a Jan. 4 memo from U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions encouraging U.S. attorneys in marijuana-legal states to enforce federal law on the plant would make valley officials even less likely to immediately allow the lounges.</p>
<p>Marijuana industry officials say lounges are needed in Las Vegas because visitors who legally purchase recreational marijuana here may not have a legal place to consume it. A lounge, which some proposals call for being attached to dispensaries, would eliminate the problem.</p>
<p>Giunchigliani said the commission would wait until the Nevada Legislature meets in 2019 in hopes that state officials pass legislation allowing for pot venues before moving forward at the local level. When state<a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/07/31/las-vegas-tick-segerblom-public-consumption-marijuana-laws/84873/"> Sen. Tick Segerblom proposed such a bill in last year&#8217;s session</a>, it was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have to look at so many factors, especially driving under the influence and how people get in and out,&#8221; Giunchigliani said. &#8220;I just want to give businesses that have spent millions of dollars on their operations to have a true conversation in this next year and come up with a list of pros and cons.&#8221;</p>

<p>Las Vegas Councilwoman Michele Fiore was the lone council member to participate in a Dec. 13 workshop with more than 100 business owners and employees in Nevada&#8217;s marijuana industry. That workshop, run by Deputy City Attorney Bryan Scott and Deputy Planning Director Mary McElhone, included a proposed city ordinance allowing lounges by March or April of this year.</p>
<p>Further action on the city ordinance was also put on hold following Sessions&#8217; memo. Fiore said she didn&#8217;t believe the memo was &#8220;a huge deal&#8221; but lack of clarity in Nevada law could unintentionally create &#8220;criminals&#8221; of local marijuana business owners.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would love to open (lounges) tomorrow, but I don&#8217;t want to jeopardize the people who have put millions of dollars and effort into doing the right thing with these businesses,&#8221; Fiore said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a slow process, and we have to make sure it&#8217;s completely figured out in Carson City.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nevada pot proponents said they remained hopeful marijuana lounges would find their way to the valley in 2018. While state law does not explicitly give permission for marijuana consumption lounges, legislative counsel Brenda Erdoes said in a letter to Segerblom in September 2017 that such lounges would be permitted as long as marijuana was not being used &#8220;unlawfully.&#8221;</p>
<p>Segerblom said that although he is disappointed his vision of Las Vegas as the first major U.S. city to open pot lounges did not materialize, Denver&#8217;s move to open such businesses was &#8220;a step forward&#8221; and could also benefit Nevada&#8217;s marijuana industry.</p>
<p>That step forward locally should include lounges where marijuana can be smoked, instead of only vaping, dabbing or using edibles like in Colorado, Segerblom said.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely restrictive,&#8221; Segerblom said of Denver&#8217;s new ordinance, &#8220;but at least they&#8217;re trying.&#8221;</p>

(AP) &#8212; Two Albuquerque city councilors are pushing to decriminalize marijuana possession in cases where a person is caught with an ounce (28 grams) or less, saying their proposal will free up police time and resources to focus on more serious crimes.</p>
<p>Councilors Pat Davis and Isaac Benton announced their proposal Monday to amend Albuquerque&#8217;s criminal code by making low-level pot possession and paraphernalia without a valid medical marijuana referral a citable offense that can come with a $25 ticket but no jail time.</p>
<p>The proposed change &#8211;which still must go before the City Council and mayor for approval &#8212; would add Albuquerque to a growing list of municipalities that have decriminalized possessing pot in small amounts, including Orlando and Pittsburgh. Nine states and Washington, D.C, have already legalized recreational marijuana.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been needed for many years,&#8221; said Emily Kaltenbach, the state director in New Mexico for the Drug Policy Alliance, which has advocated nationally for easing drug sentencing laws. &#8220;New Mexico is sort of behind the curve when it comes to marijuana reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added that a single arrest for marijuana possession can hinder a person&#8217;s chances at securing housing or student loans. New Mexico is also among a handful of states where marijuana possession on a person&#8217;s record can block his or her chances of getting approval to adopt a child, she said.</p>
<p>Under the city&#8217;s criminal code now, police can issue $50 fines to first-time offenders possessing an ounce or less of marijuana. Authorities can also decide to send the first-time offenders to jail for a maximum of 15 days, though such instances appear to be rare. The fines and penalties increase with a second violation.</p>
<p>A review of Metropolitan Detention Center bookings over the past week showed no one was booked into the jail following an Albuquerque police arrest on a sole petty misdemeanor charge of paraphernalia or marijuana possession. Bernalillo County Sheriff&#8217;s deputies only made one such arrest in Albuquerque resulting in a jail booking in Albuquerque in the same period.</p>
<p>The low rate of arrests has raised some question from skeptics, including Rep. Monica Youngblood, an Albuquerque Republican, over the proposal&#8217;s impact. As a state lawmaker, she expressed opposition to legalizing marijuana in the past, saying she believes the state has bigger problems to address.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that people are being arrested or rearrested or that the justice system is being packed with all of these low-level possession crimes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see that it&#8217;s an issue or something we should be concerned about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Citing Albuquerque police data, Davis, a former law enforcement officer and Democrat, said that in a recent 12-month period there were 177 instances in which marijuana possession was listed as the top offense. Each arrest or citation was likely to have resulted in potentially hours of police time to process.</p>
<p>In 2015, a similar proposal went before the City Council, but was vetoed by Mayor Richard Berry, a Republican. Berry was replaced late last year by Tim Keller, a Democrat.</p>
<p>Davis said he believes the proposal&#8217;s prospects have been boosted by the change in administrations.</p>
<p>The measure also has backing from the city&#8217;s police union.</p>

She and her husband had always done what they believed was right for their autistic daughter, Kara. But now, the judge could decide they were criminals, or at least her husband was, and not allow him to be Kara&#8217;s guardian.</p>
<p>Christy leaned forward, her glasses perched atop blonde bangs, as she listened to her attorney&#8217;s questions. She glanced at Kara, her 98-pound 18-year-old, seated in a wheelchair by her own attorney in the courtroom in downtown Dallas.</p>
<p>&#8220;<a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/03/01/texas-medical-marijuana-autism-father/74523/">Mark, your child&#8217;s father, was investigated by Child Protective Services for having administered cannabis vapor to Kara</a>,&#8221; her lawyer said. &#8220;Do you recall that?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, her voice shaking.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why has he done that?&#8221; her lawyer asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kara is a severe case of autism with self-injurious behavior,&#8221; said Christy, 50, a nurse practitioner. &#8220;She punches her head pretty significantly and she has caused brain damage. It prevents her from causing further head trauma and brain damage.&#8221;</p>
<p>As his wife spoke, Mark Zartler shifted his eyes between her and Judge Brenda Hull Thompson, who sat solemn-faced. She alone would decide the family&#8217;s fate.</p>
<p>If she ruled Mark Zartler &#8220;unsuitable&#8221; to be Kara&#8217;s guardian, that could mean big changes for the family. Christy alone would be Kara&#8217;s guardian, so if anything happened to her, Kara could become a ward of the state. To avoid that, the family would probably move to Colorado or somewhere marijuana is legal. They both have elderly parents to care for, and even so, they don&#8217;t want to leave. Texas is home.</p>
<p>The lawyer&#8217;s voice grew impassioned as he spoke of Mark having a child abuse record for trying to protect his daughter by using marijuana.</p>
<p>&#8220;In fact, paradoxically, it prevents abuse,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It prevents self-abuse. Is that correct?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Correct,&#8221; Christy said, nodding.</p>

<p>Christy&#8217;s testimony ended. Their lawyer called Mark to the stand.</p>
<p>As Mark passed his wife, each extended an arm toward the other and they touched hands.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Kara, who is unable to speak, usually loves sleeping, but she woke early Thursday in her pink bedroom in Richardson. Her mother was already up too. Maybe Kara could feel the nervous energy in the house.</p>
<p>Christy velcroed Kara&#8217;s multicolored orthotics onto her feet and ankles, as Kara rocked in her favorite chair in the living room. Mark ran a brush through Kara&#8217;s short brown hair.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a big day,&#8221; Christy sang to Kara. &#8220;Your hair looks beautiful, girl.&#8221;</p>
<p>For the occasion, Christy had gone to Target the night before to buy Kara a new outfit. She decided on a loose-fitting floral pantsuit and a special silver necklace.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, guardianship hearings are something of a formality for families with disabled children who turn 18. They usually last 10 minutes. The parents, or other guardians, must prove that the person is unable to live independently and that the parents are qualified to oversee the person&#8217;s life. Someone placed under guardianship loses the right to vote, to marry, to make medical decisions.</p>
<p>But Christy and Mark knew they had made their situation atypical. Their lawyer warned them that they could lose.</p>
<p>Christy and Mark dressed themselves with care, too, thinking about the impression they&#8217;d make on the judge. Even though both have long considered themselves Republicans, they were glad they got a Democrat instead of a hardline conservative.</p>
<p>Christy first slipped on a black, white and gray dress. It could send the message, she thought, that their situation doesn&#8217;t fit into black or white extremes, but exists in a gray area: Giving Kara marijuana is illegal, but not morally wrong.</p>
<p>Mark asked if color would be more optimistic. Christy went with a dress splotched with bright blue, purple, pink and green.</p>
<p>Mark, 49, a software engineer who works from home, didn&#8217;t have much choice for clothing &#8212; he owns one suit that fits. He bought it 27 years ago in college, when he and Christy were dating and he was about to go on job interviews.</p>
<p>Back then, they had no idea the direction their lives would take. No idea that they&#8217;d one day become marijuana activists.</p>

<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>They started on that path Nov. 10, 1999, with the three-months-premature birth of their twin girls. Keeley developed healthily, but Kara had cerebral palsy and severe autism.</p>
<p>At age 4, Kara started suffering fits of self-abuse, often smashing her hand into her face. She has broken bones. Her school has recorded her hitting herself 3,000 times in one day; it was considered a good day if she hit under 1,000 times.</p>
<p>Her parents tried every anti-psychotic drug out there. Most of them turned her into a catatonic zombie, they said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We could strip away her personality, but it didn&#8217;t stop the hitting,&#8221; Mark said.</p>
<p>About seven years ago, a neighbor suggested the parents try marijuana. They scoffed at the idea, but accepted a pot brownie from him. When they gave it to Kara before a road trip, she was calm for five hours and interested in looking out the window &#8212; when usually she&#8217;d be yelling and punching herself.</p>

<hr>
<p>Since then, the Zartlers have found marijuana to be the only drug that works for Kara every time. It also has allowed her personality and sense of humor to emerge. Her doctors have told the family it&#8217;s good they found something that works, but they can&#8217;t recommend breaking the law.</p>
<p>Last year, the Zartlers felt the political winds could be turning. They figured they, as law-abiding, Christian, Republican Texans, had a shot at being the &#8220;poster children&#8221; who could persuade lawmakers to legalize medical marijuana for autism patients.</p>
<p>They shot a video of Kara having a fit, and Mark administering marijuana vapor to her using a medical mask. In the video, she quickly stops hitting herself after inhaling the vapor. The video went viral online, drawing than 70 million views. The Zartlers made the local and national news.</p>
<p>The family spent long days traveling to Austin, trudging the Capitol for hours on end, showing lawmakers their video and pleading with them to support a marijuana bill for autistic patients.</p>
<p>Over and over, the legislators and their aides expressed sympathy. But over and over, they declined to take a stand. In the end, nothing that would help the family passed.</p>
<p>The video also drew the attention of Child Protective Services, which investigated Mark and found &#8220;reason to believe&#8221; he had physically abused Kara. Under state law, physical abuse is defined in part by giving a child an illegal drug.</p>
<h3>Watch the dramatic change after Kara Zartler takes her medicine</h3>
<p><iframe src="//www.washingtonpost.com/video/c/embed/65bcc30a-fd8e-11e6-9b78-824ccab94435?allowPreroll=0&amp;e=0" width="640" height="400" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-category-id="segments" data-aspect-ratio="0.5621"></iframe><br>
Over the past year, the Zartlers have seen dramatic improvements in Kara&#8217;s development, they said. Because of the media attention, she has gotten used to having cameras around. She smiles at the lens and often seems to pose, which delights her parents. She also has learned to use the bathroom by herself and no longer needs diapers all the time &#8212; a huge step toward a more independent life.</p>
<p>In the weeks before the hearing, Kara&#8217;s court-appointed attorney visited the family and read Kara her rights, as Kara walked around the kitchen eating. She gave Kara a spiral-bound book, called &#8220;Kara Goes To Court,&#8221; that explained the upcoming hearing.</p>
<p>Before leaving the house Thursday morning, Christy gave the book to Kara to flip through one last time.</p>
<p>&#8220;In the Court, there will be a JUDGE,&#8221; the page said. &#8220;The judge is very nice and will be wearing a long black robe. &#8230; The Judge will make a decision. Everyone must follow what the Judge decides.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kara grazed her fingers along the photo of the smiling judge.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s the judge &#8212; who&#8217;s up for re-election, by the way,&#8221; Christy said. &#8220;We&#8217;ll see if we vote for her after today.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Outside the courtroom, Kara&#8217;s attorney, Ellen Williamson, acknowledged that the situation was unique.</p>
<p>In her role, she said, she must &#8220;start from the position of &#8216;We oppose the guardianship,&#8217; because it&#8217;s the most restrictive thing we do to someone, other than putting them in prison.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rather than actively contest the guardianship, though, she said she sees her job as making the Zartlers prove that they&#8217;re qualified.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re parents who are doing a good job,&#8221; Williamson said. &#8220;They&#8217;re in a predicament. It&#8217;s a bit of a catch-22. You&#8217;re doing something to be a parent but also doing something that the law doesn&#8217;t allow. I wouldn&#8217;t be doing my job to not bring that (CPS) information up.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the courtroom, the parents&#8217; lawyer, Rick O&#8217;Connor, brought up Mark&#8217;s CPS record. O&#8217;Connor, 63, knew the Zartlers&#8217; struggle all too well &#8212; his older brother was also severely autistic and would often bite his own hand.</p>

<hr>
<p>He read aloud from a court investigator&#8217;s report, which cited the CPS investigation: &#8220;It did not appear that Mr. Zartler uses the marijuana with his daughter in an abusive way.&#8221;</p>
<p>He asked Mark whether the cannabis was the family&#8217;s last resort.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; Mark replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kara&#8217;s pretty docile today &#8212; is that unusual?&#8221; the attorney asked.</p>
<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s asleep,&#8221; Mark said, laughing in disbelief as he looked at his usually rambunctious daughter&#8217;s head slumped in her wheelchair. &#8220;It&#8217;s unusual.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>Judge Hull Thompson was ready to rule.</p>
<p>&#8220;The court finds it would be for the protection of the rights of (Kara) as well as in (her) best interest for the court to appoint guardians,&#8221; Thompson said.</p>
<p>Both Mark and Christy were qualified to be guardians, she ruled.</p>
<p>The parents smiled at each other and swallowed back tears. They raised their right hands and swore an oath to uphold Kara&#8217;s rights.</p>
<p>Outside the courtroom, Christy tapped Kara&#8217;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did it!&#8221; she said. Kara was still asleep. The parents couldn&#8217;t believe it &#8212; not only had they gotten what they hoped for, but Kara didn&#8217;t make a scene at all. It was the first time she had ever slept in public.</p>
<p>The family&#8217;s joy was mixed, however. They wished Kara could grow into an adult and take care of herself. They looked at Keeley, Kara&#8217;s twin, with her car and job and plans for college in the fall, and wished Kara could be there too.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s emotional because this is not really a natural thing,&#8221; Christy said, tears welling. &#8220;It&#8217;s not natural to take guardianship of anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a disabled adult, Kara can attend high school for four more years. After that, her parents hope, she can live in a group home. It&#8217;s a natural instinct, the Zartlers believe, to want to be around other people, to be independent from one&#8217;s parents. Kara, they think, must want that too.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In 2017 the National Institute on Drug Abuse </span><a href="https://www.drugabuse.gov/related-topics/trends-statistics/overdose-death-rates" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style="font-weight: 400">reported</span></i></a><span style="font-weight: 400">&#160;that roughly 64,000 Americans overdosed during the prior year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hurd, a professor of psychiatry and neuroscience, said she believes the CBD cannabinoid holds the key to suppressing obsessive cravings for opioids and heroin. A member of the National Academy of Medicine, Dr. Hurd has asked the global scientific community to help research the intriguing interaction between </span><span style="font-weight: 400">c</span><span style="font-weight: 400">annabidiol and addiction recovery.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Calling for all scientific &#8220;hands on deck,&#8221; Hurd believes there&#8217;s a strong chance the second most prominent cannabinoid found in marijuana could dramatically help reduce America&#8217;s addiction to heroin, opioids, and other addictive pharmaceuticals.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Hurd&#8217;s initial research, she discovered c</span><span style="font-weight: 400">annabidiol reportedly</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> &#8220;decreased cravings and anxiety without producing any psychoactive effects&#8221; in the test animals. Unclear as to the cause-and-effect, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">Dr. Hurd is asking the global scientific community to participate in CBD research. </span></p>

<p>Matt Cochran &#8211; who was <a href="https://mjbizmagazine.com/digital-issues/2017-08-Sep/#116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired last summer</a> by Partner Colorado CEO Sundie Seefried and now accuses her of repeated cocaine use &#8211; is one of three defendants in <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Matt-Cochran-lawsuit-against.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a suit brought by three Colorado investors</a> in a state district court.</p>
<p>In their suit, filed last June, the investors allege they were misled about a marijuana financial services company, Colorado-based BudTeller, where Cochran was president, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Cochran denies the allegations. One of the three defendants has since reached a settlement.</p>
<p><a href="https://mjbizconference.com/next/?utm_source=daily%20website&amp;utm_medium=banner&amp;utm_campaign=Early%20Bird%20NEXT%202018&amp;_ga=2.116676806.1530335314.1519056354-932032620.1493223513" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-66014" src="https://mjbizdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/NEXT2018-3-square.jpg" alt="" width="300"></a>The case raises questions about Cochran&#8217;s own background as well as his suit targeting Seefried, Partner Colorado and Safe Harbor Services, a new marijuana banking business majority-owned by the credit union.</p>
<p>At the same time, the legal maneuvering has raised questions about the future of Safe Harbor Services and its ambitious plan to serve cannabis businesses across the nation.</p>
<p>The president of a Las Vegas-based company hired to develop banking compliance software for Safe Harbor said the unit faces financial difficulties because of Cochran&#8217;s lawsuit, which was filed in January.</p>
<p>&#8220;Safe Harbor is in a pretty tenuous position right now because they have no capital, no assets, no ability to raise capital with the lawsuit against them,&#8221; said Cody Hershey, president of Integrated Compliance Solutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;So, they&#8217;re in a tough spot because they can&#8217;t really raise capital.&#8221;</p>
<p>The software company ended its business relationship with Safe Harbor earlier this month.</p>
<p>Safe Harbor declined to comment on Hershey&#8217;s assessment.</p>
<p><strong>Investor lawsuit</strong></p>
<div id="attachment_86048" style="max-width: 195px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-86048" src="https://mjbizdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Matt-Cochran-cropped.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="233"><p class="wp-caption-text">Matt Cochran</p></div>
<p>In their lawsuit against Cochran, the investors &#8211; Michael McGonigle, Celeste Pfeifer and Richard Wigton &#8211; said they lost roughly $300,000 through their investments in BudTeller.</p>
<p>Calls to the phone number listed on the BudTeller website did not go through.</p>
<p>According to the investors&#8217; lawsuit, Cochran and two other defendants &#8211; Michael Connolly and Larry Sherman &#8211; solicited the trio to invest in BudTeller&#8217;s parent, Teller Holdings. Efforts to reach Connolly and Sherman were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>The three investors said BudTeller was pitched as offering banking, credit card processing, cash management and compliance solutions to the cannabis industry.</p>
<p>Those services would purportedly be offered through kiosks in licensed marijuana stores.</p>
<p>The investors said they were told that BudTeller would need to pay consulting and legal fees of $1,000 a month over two years, or a total of $24,000.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, the defendants also told the three investors that BudTeller&#8217;s kiosks were fully functional and the company would be profitable by July 2016.</p>
<p>Persuaded by the pitch, the investors each formed a limited liability company in 2016, according to their lawsuit. Each pumped $100,000 into BudTeller.</p>
<p>Soon afterward, however, the three said they learned that BudTeller&#8217;s services and kiosks were not operational.</p>
<p>According to their lawsuit, the investors also learned BudTeller had signed a consulting agreement with a Colorado firm, Fidelity Consulting.</p>
<p>The suit contends that the head of Fidelity Consulting was Michael Connolly, Cochran&#8217;s co-defendant, and the contract Fidelity signed with BudTeller was valued at $300,000 &#8211; the same sum the three investors had wagered on BudTeller.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, the plaintiffs learned after investing in Teller Holdings that Cochran was alleged to have used company funds for personal use in a job he held before BudTeller.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, &#8220;despite Plaintiffs&#8217; combined investment of $300,000 as of May 2016, BudTeller had no revenue and only $30,000 remaining in its account by September 1, 2016.&#8221;</p>
<p>The suit noted that the company had ceased operating.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs&#8217; attorney in the BudTeller case, Ronald Wilcox of the Wilcox Law Firm in Denver, said he had not yet identified at which company Cochran allegedly misspent the funds.</p>
<p>Cochran has denied the allegations and said the suit will soon be done.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re at the 1-yard line of this going away,&#8221; Cochran said of the suit in a phone interview. He declined to specify if he expected the suit to be dropped, dismissed or closed in some other way.</p>
<p>But Wilcox, the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyer, wrote in an email that the suit is not going away.</p>
<p>He explained that the plaintiffs had settled with one of the BudTeller defendants, Larry Sherman, and that in closing Sherman&#8217;s case the court had inadvertently concluded the case against Cochran and Connolly.</p>
<p>Wilcox said the court has been informed of the error and expects the lawsuit against Cochran and Connolly to be reinstated shortly.</p>
<p><strong>Wrongful termination case</strong></p>
<p>Cochran&#8217;s lawsuit comes after Seefried <a href="https://mjbizmagazine.com/digital-issues/2017-08-Sep/#116" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hired him</a> last July to help launch Safe Harbor.</p>
<p>The unit was created to help financial institutions comply with rules and laws when serving MJ companies.</p>
<p>In the lawsuit, filed last month in a Colorado district court, Cochran and his wife, Mindy Ganze, allege Seefried improperly fired the couple last year.</p>
<p>The suit contends Ganze, who briefly worked for Seefried, was ousted in part because she witnessed Seefried use cocaine on several occasions.</p>
<p>Safe Harbor vehemently denies the allegations, calling them &#8220;groundless.&#8221;</p>
<p>Seefried was not available for comment.</p>
<p><strong>Safe Harbor&#8217;s future</strong></p>
<p>Cochran&#8217;s lawsuit has raised questions about Safe Harbor&#8217;s own future.</p>
<p>Integrated Compliance Solutions ended its agreement with Safe Harbor earlier this month after the software company said it hadn&#8217;t been paid for two months.</p>
<p>Hershey, the company&#8217;s president, also said Safe Harbor committed other contractual violations.</p>
<p>Without a software developer, Safe Harbor&#8217;s mission to bring <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/marijuana-banking-landscape-may-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabis banking</a> to legalized states across America would seem to be in jeopardy.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve acknowledged that there were some illegal acts committed and some breaches of fiduciary duty, and they&#8217;ve basically said, &#8216;What makes this all go away?&#8217;&#8221; Hershey said.</p>
<p>Hershey said Integrated Compliance Solutions has made settlement proposals to Safe Harbor that include taking over the company.</p>
<div id="attachment_54274" style="max-width: 195px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><img class="size-full wp-image-54274" src="https://mjbizdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/Sundie-Seefried-Cropped-e1471372422878.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="199"><p class="wp-caption-text">Sundie Seefried</p></div>
<p>Cochran&#8217;s attorney has made a similar settlement proposal to Safe Harbor, but the credit union rejected it, he said.</p>
<p>The proposal would reinstate Cochran in the company, remove Seefried as chairwoman and reduce Partner&#8217;s stake in Safe Harbor &#8211; currently at 80% &#8211; to below 50%, according to Robert Liechty of the Hamilton Faatz law firm in Colorado.</p>
<p>Liechty is representing Cochran and Hershey.</p>
<p>Donnie Emmi, a lawyer for Safe Harbor&#8217;s parent, Partner Colorado, said that while the company typically doesn&#8217;t comment on litigation, &#8220;we will say there has been no acknowledgement that illegal acts were committed, so Mr. Hershey&#8217;s and Mr. Cochran&#8217;s statements regarding such are completely manufactured.&#8221;</p>
<p>Emmi also said there&#160;is &#8220;no pending settlement deadline or current settlement discussions&#8221; with Cochran or ICS.</p>
<p>&#8220;Safe Harbor will defend the baseless allegations in court and will proceed accordingly with ICS, despite their efforts to use the press to try and malign Safe Harbor&#8217;s good name,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it&#8217;s unclear whether businesses that have worked with Safe Harbor will continue to do so.</p>
<p>CanPay, which partnered with Partner Colorado <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/marijuana-banking-landscape-may-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on a payment system in Hawaii</a>, declined to comment on whether it&#8217;s still working with Safe Harbor.</p>
<p>Colorado-based CanPay offers electronic payment solutions to marijuana businesses.</p>

<p>In the push for cannabis legalization, the link between cannabis and schizophrenia sometimes enters the discussion. Many fear that cannabis increases risk for developing schizophrenia, while others declare its value in helping relieve symptoms of the condition. But what does the research say about the role of cannabis in developing&#8212;and potentially treating&#8212;schizophrenia?<strong>&#160;</strong></p>

<h2>What Is Schizophrenia?</h2>
<p>Schizophrenia refers to a group of conditions in which brain function is so impaired that sufferers lose touch with reality. It affects over <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/statistics/schizophrenia.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7.5 million</a> adults in the United States, usually starting in their early 20s for men and slightly later in life for women.</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">Traditional treatments do little to treat negative symptoms such as a flat emotional state, a struggle to feel pleasure, and a lack of motivation to engage socially.</div>
<p>Psychosis isn&#8217;t the only defining feature of schizophrenia. The condition is a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nrdp201567" target="_blank" rel="noopener">complex</a> syndrome characterized by a range of symptoms that fall into <em>positive</em>, <em>negative</em>, and <em>cognitive </em>categories. Positive symptoms are the delusions, hallucinations, and disorganized speech that characterize psychosis and are associated with losing touch from reality. Pharmaceutical treatments for schizophrenia, called antipsychotic medications, target these positive symptoms.</p>
<p>Traditional pharmaceutical treatments, though, do little to treat negative symptoms such as a flat emotional state, a struggle to feel pleasure, and a lack of motivation to engage socially. They also fail to improve cognitive deficits, often leaving patients with impaired attention, memory, and problem-solving abilities.</p>

<h2>The Schizophrenic Brain</h2>
<p>Predicting who is going to develop schizophrenia is a challenge for health care providers as there are no clear structural brain changes that can be <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22907121" target="_blank" rel="noopener">detected</a> before symptoms arise. Instead, the development of schizophrenia begins with abnormal communication patterns between groups of brain cells.</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">The risk of experiencing psychotic episodes increases with THC dose.</div>
<p>The abnormal communication patterns found in schizophrenia present in multiple ways, but the most common are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4902122/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dysfunction</a> in two types of brain chemical systems: glutamate and dopamine. These chemicals, also called neurotransmitters, are used by brain cells to communicate with one another by activating receptors on other brain cells.</p>
<p>Glutamate is one of the most common neurotransmitters in the brain, activating a variety of receptors, including <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5518924/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NMDA</a> receptors. Activating NMDA receptors is an important step in brain cells forming <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/human-biology/neuron-nervous-system/a/the-synapse" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connections</a> with one another, and they play a critical role in brain development, learning, and memory. Many individuals with schizophrenia have abnormally low NMDA receptor activity, which can impair brain development and cognitive performance. In some cases, it&#8217;s this low NMDA receptor activity that leads to the schizophrenia symptoms later in life.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/health/how-marijuana-affects-the-brain"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29202739/how-marijuana-affects-the-brain-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">How Does Cannabis Consumption Affect the Brain?</div></div></a></div>
<p>The other neurotransmitter commonly implicated in schizophrenia is dopamine. Schizophrenic brains typically exhibit abnormally high levels of activity in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC33999/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">D2</a> dopamine receptors, which are found throughout the brain&#8217;s limbic system&#8212;the system that regulates our emotions and motivational states. Abnormally high D2 receptor activity can lead to a host of schizophrenia symptoms such as an impaired grasp of reality, emotional dysregulation, and weakened cognitive abilities. Antipsychotic medications work by blocking the activity of D2 receptors.</p>
<h2>Cannabis and Schizophrenia Risk Factors</h2>
<p>The abnormal connections between brain cells that cause schizophrenia symptoms are triggered by an interaction of genetic issues and environmental factors, such as childhood trauma or cannabis exposure. One genetic trait, on its own, is usually insufficient to cause schizophrenia, nor is an environmental factor like cannabis use on its own. Taken in concert, though, these factors can cause the risk of schizophrenia to spike.</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">CBD is thought to have antipsychotic effects, but the greatest evidence for its antipsychotic ability is through blocking THC-induced psychosis.</div>
<p>The brain goes through critical periods of development during childhood and adolescence. Exposure to THC, the high-inducing chemical in cannabis, during this time is a substantial environmental risk factor for schizophrenia. This risk stems from the importance of the <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/science-tech/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system">endogenous cannabinoid system (ECS)</a>, specifically cannabinoid type I (CB1) receptors, in controlling how neurons <a href="http://www.jneurosci.org/content/36/26/7039" target="_blank" rel="noopener">connect</a> and communicate with one another. Indeed, there is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24904437" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence</a> that THC can cause psychotic episodes immediately after using cannabis, some of which can persist after the effects of THC and require clinical intervention. The risk of experiencing these psychotic episodes increases with THC <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2424288/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dose</a>.</p>

<p>The association between cannabis and schizophrenia is well-established; it&#8217;s been estimated that <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/causal-association-between-cannabis-and-psychosis-examination-of-the-evidence/71BA37D16485F186CE7B6B785E5B69A4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8%</a> of worldwide cases of schizophrenia can be attributed to cannabis. It should be noted, however, that while some studies claim that cannabis use plays a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/mp2016252" target="_blank" rel="noopener">causal</a> role in schizophrenia development, it can&#8217;t be ruled out that those who are more likely to develop schizophrenia are simply more prone to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4382963/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">use</a> cannabis.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that the cannabinoid composition of cannabis is often not considered in these studies. What about other cannabis constituents like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22716160" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabidiol</a> (CBD), which has been found to have some antipsychotic properties?</p>
<h2>Why the THC Risk?</h2>
<p>As noted, genetic factors alone aren&#8217;t sufficient to cause schizophrenia. But when THC hits the brain, it may act as an environmental trigger for the condition. Evidence that THC exacerbates the genetically-determined risk of psychosis is found in brain cell connections. THC activation of CB1 receptors reduces the brain chemical, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26987641" target="_blank" rel="noopener">glutamate</a>, which in turn, reduces NMDA receptor activation (see above). When THC activates CB1 receptors, it impairs glutamate production, which in turn lowers activity among&#160;NMDA receptors, ramping up the risk for the onset of schizophrenia.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/health/a-physicians-perspective-on-optimal-cannabis-dosing"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/23203951/physician-guide-cannabis-dosing-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">A Physician&#8217;s Perspective on Optimal Cannabis Dosing</div></div></a></div>
<p>THC exposure can also impact dopamine receptors like D2. When D2 receptor activation is elevated, the brain cells in the limbic system become overly sensitive. In a normal brain, CB1 receptors reduce this sensitivity and contribute to normal brain activity. However, too much THC can weaken the strength of CB1 receptors, leading to an overall elevation of dopamine levels, elevated D2 receptor activity, and the psychosis that can accompany it.</p>
<h2>How Does CBD Affect Schizophrenia?</h2>
<p>The non-intoxicating cannabinoid CBD is being considered as a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22716160" target="_blank" rel="noopener">treatment</a> for schizophrenia. CBD is thought to have antipsychotic effects, but the greatest evidence for its antipsychotic ability is through <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22716160" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blocking</a> THC-induced psychosis. On its own, the effects of CBD on schizophrenia symptoms have been mixed. In one <a href="http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0269881106060967" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a>, CBD did not improve psychotic symptoms in patients that responded poorly to traditional antipsychotic treatment. A larger <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29241357" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a>, though, found that CBD effectively reduced psychotic symptoms.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/science-tech/what-does-cbd-do"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/02122804/cbd-week-brain-2-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">CBD and the Brain: What Does It Do and What Is It Good For?</div></div></a></div>
<p>CBD also has promise in improving the difficult-to-treat negative symptoms and cognitive impairment caused by schizophrenia. Studies in animals found that CBD <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28230072" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved</a> some of the negative symptoms such as social interaction deficits and working memory deficits.</p>
<p>One significant benefit of CBD, should it prove to be an effective antipsychotic medication, is that it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29241357" target="_blank" rel="noopener">well-tolerated</a> and has fewer side effects compared to traditional antipsychotics. For instance, CBD doesn&#8217;t <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28230072" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impact</a> food intake or weight gain which is a common adverse side effect of antipsychotic medications. More work is needed to hash out these variable effects in humans, but in the meantime, keep the potential risks of THC in mind if you&#8217;re at all concerned about cannabis&#8217; effect on schizophrenia.</p>

<p>Showing their pent-up demand for action, proponents packed the hearing and cheered when medical marijuana was touted as a viable option to help with chronic pain or certain diseases.</p>
<p>&#8220;House Bill 166 is not about a party,&#8221; said Jaime Montalvo, president of the group Kentuckians for Medicinal Marijuana. &#8220;It&#8217;s not about having fun. This is about sick patients, qualifying patients, having safe access to a plant created by our Creator.&#8221;</p>
<p>The bill resulted from work by a task force led by Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 2014.</p>

<p>State Rep. John Sims Jr., the bill&#8217;s lead sponsor, said legalizing medical cannabis would help combat Kentucky&#8217;s deadly addiction woes from opioid painkillers. Supporters cited studies showing a sharp drop in opioid prescriptions in states where medical marijuana is allowed. Twenty-nine states have legalized it, they said.</p>
<p>Kentucky&#8217;s lack of a medical marijuana law has created a &#8220;medical refugee crisis,&#8221; said Sims, a Democrat from Flemingsburg. Kentuckians have uprooted their lives to seek the treatment for themselves or loved ones in states where medical cannabis is legal, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is about patients who have exhausted all their options and resources and now are begging us to pull our heads from the sand to help,&#8221; Sims told the committee.</p>

<p>More than 20 House members from both parties have signed on as co-sponsors. The bill would strictly regulate and license use of medical cannabis in Kentucky, and those seeking access would have to clear multiple steps, including approval from a new state enforcement agency. Potential patients would have to show they have qualifying conditions, such as cancer, chronic pain, multiple sclerosis and post-traumatic stress disorder. If approved, they would be given a special ID and would have to go to state-approved dispensaries to purchase the medical marijuana.</p>

<p>Each step of the process would be licensed &#8212; from those growing cannabis, to the processors, distributors and dispensaries. An excise tax would be imposed at the wholesale level.</p>
<p>Participation would be optional for local communities. City and county governing bodies would decide whether to allow local medical cannabis licensing. If elected officials refused to act, local residents eventually could mount efforts to put the issue on the local ballot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do the right thing,&#8221; Democratic state Rep. Al Gentry told the committee. &#8220;Give the people what they want, and allow certain suffering Kentuckians access to a product that is known to be safer and more effective for them.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">Cannabis</a> laws in Maryland have been gradually evolving over the past few years. In the latest developments, the right to grow industrial hemp could be coming to Maryland. This change could pave the way for a stronger medical program and additional research.</p>
<h2>Industrial Hemp in Maryland</h2>
<p>Earlier today, the Maryland House of Delegates voted overwhelmingly in favor of a proposal to allow farmers to <a href="https://hightimes.com/grow/grow-weed-guide-beginners/">grow</a> industrial <a href="https://hightimes.com/culture/get-hot-hemp/">hemp</a>. The measure won by a landslide 136-1 majority.</p>
<p>From here, the bill will now move onto the Senate.&#160;As the <a href="https://www.abc2news.com/news/state/maryland-house-oks-bill-allowing-farmers-to-grow-hemp" rel="nofollow">Associated Press</a> reported, the measure would allow farmers in the state to grow hemp as long as they do so in partnership with a university or a state agency.</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s winning vote is the latest development in Maryland&#8217;s legal framework for cannabis. Back in 2012, the state approved a legal medical marijuana program. But it took several years before the program was up and running. It wasn&#8217;t until the <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/friday-appears-to-be-the-day-medical-marijuana-will-go-on-sale-in-maryland/2017/12/01/62d66dee-d605-11e7-95bf-df7c19270879_story.html?utm_term=.8f0dfda36dbe" rel="nofollow">end of 2017</a> that medical cannabis dispensaries were finally able to sell products.</p>
<p>Also during 2017, the state took steps to boost its production of medical cannabis. Throughout the second half of last year, state regulators <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/3-mmj-growers-get-final-ok-in-maryland/">approved three additional growers</a> and two new cannabis processing facilities. Under the state&#8217;s medical marijuana laws, there can be up to 15 growers in Maryland.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Along with changes on the medical marijuana front, the state has also made some minor adjustments for laws governing recreational cannabis use. Most importantly, the state <a href="https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/14/maryland-marijuana-decriminalization_n_5107412.html" rel="nofollow">decriminalized marijuana</a> possession back in 2014.</p>
<p>Since the 2014 change, people caught with 10 grams of weed or less will get a fine of up to $100 instead of getting arrested. If a person is caught with weed a second time they can be fined as much as $250. Every time after that, the citation can run as high as $500.</p>
<h2>Final Hit: The Right To Grow Industrial Hemp Could Be Coming To Maryland</h2>
<p>Today could mark the beginning of the next phase in Maryland&#8217;s weed laws. If the state Senate approves this new bill, the right to <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/hemp-growers-may-take-on-dea-over-its-surprising-rescheduling-of-extracts/">grow industrial hemp</a> could be coming to Maryland very soon.</p>
<p>In many ways, hemp exists in a legal gray zone. On the one hand, since it&#8217;s technically a <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis plant</a>, it can be classified as a federally illegal substance. But according to the AP, the 2014 Farm Bill gives state agricultural departments the power to define whether or not industrial hemp can be grown.</p>
<p>There are many reasons why a state may choose to allow the cultivation of hemp. The plant has long been used for its fibers, which can be spun into a number of textiles. More recently, producers of <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/cannabidiol-cbd/">CBD</a> products have turned to hemp as a way of working around prohibition laws in order to legally make CBD.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Hemp plants have virtually no <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/science/thc-tetrahydrocannabinol/">THC</a>, which makes them more or less immune from federal cannabis prohibition. At the same time, it&#8217;s possible to extract enough CBD from hemp plants to make viable medical products.</p>
<p>Now, if Maryland approves its newest weed-related bill, farmers could soon be growing and harvesting hemp. And since these plants would have to be grown in partnership with state agencies or universities, it seems like they would be used primarily for medical products and research.</p>

<p>Sheriff Chris Fitzgerald says authorities seized more than 300 marijuana plants on Thursday, after a monthlong investigation. They arrested a 37-year-old man on suspicion of drug manufacturing.</p>
<p>The law enforcement operation involved the sheriff&#8217;s offices from Barron, Rusk and Washburn counties, along with the state Department of Criminal Investigation.</p>

<p>&#8220;New Mexico is sort of behind the curve when it comes to <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a> reform,&#8221; admitted the director of the state&#8217;s Drug Policy Alliance, Emily Kaltenbach in a recent interview. &#8220;It&#8217;s been needed for many years,&#8221; she said. But burgeoning public support and a mayor&#8217;s office controlled by a Democrat seem to be nudging the needle forward. On Monday, Albuquerque lawmakers considering marijuana decriminalization announced their proposal to amend the city&#8217;s criminal code. But skeptics doubt whether the proposal will really decrease demands on law enforcement as proponents claim.</p>
<h2>Albuquerque Lawmakers Considering Marijuana Decriminalization</h2>
<p>On Monday, city councilors Pat Davis and Isaac Benton introduced their proposal to change the way the Albuquerque handles minor cannabis possession violations. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/pot-decriminalization-proposed-for-new-mexicos-biggest-city/2018/03/05/cd023bbc-20dd-11e8-946c-9420060cb7bd_story.html?utm_term=.81825c2a74d3" rel="nofollow">proposed changes</a> would replace punitive criminal convictions for marijuana possession with civil infractions.</p>
<p>Under the current criminal code, possession of up to an ounce of cannabis or of &#8220;<a href="https://hightimes.com/products/best-vape-pens-2017-concentrates/">paraphernalia</a>&#8221; would strap a first-time offender with a $50 fine and a maximum of 15 days in jail, leaving the punishment largely up to the arresting officer. Fines and jail time for repeat offenders increases, up to 90 days.</p>
<p>The conviction also goes on the offender&#8217;s criminal record. As a result, a single arrest can hurt a person&#8217;s chances of getting housing or <a href="https://hightimes.com/culture/casualties-of-war-how-prohibition-affects-education/">student loans</a> for college. Marijuana convictions can even threaten a person&#8217;s chance of adopting a child, a consequence only in New Mexico and a handful of other states.</p>
<p>The proposal submitted Monday, however, would reduce penalties for possession to a $25 ticket with no prospect of jail time. In other words, possession of paraphernalia and/or up to an ounce of marijuana would result in a simple civil infraction. And nothing would go on a person&#8217;s record.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>The last time a similar proposal came out of the Albuquerque city council <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/politics/albuquerque-lawmakers-attempting-to-decriminalize-marijuana/">was in 2015</a>. The measure passed the council on a 5-4 vote, but Republican Mayor Richard Berry ultimately vetoed it. The city of Santa Fe had better luck in 2014 when it <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/laws/santa-fe-cops-still-busting-marijuana-users-despite-decriminalization/">decriminalized small quantities of cannabis</a>.</p>
<p>Councilmen Davis and Benton still need to bring their proposal to a vote in the council, and mayor Tim Keller, a Democrat, has to sign it if it passes. The proposed measure has <a href="http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/pot-decriminalization-proposed-for-new-mexico-s-biggest-city/article_4521d3ca-67cb-549d-a8e8-12c610c26ed0.html" rel="nofollow">support</a> from the Albuquerque police union, according to the AP.</p>
<h2>Albuquerque Officials Say There&#8217;s No Problem With Cannabis Crime</h2>
<p>There are <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/global-commission-decriminalize-all-drug-possession-worldwide/">many arguments in favor of decriminalizing</a> the possession of small amounts of cannabis. But the argument Davis and Benton are making, that their proposal will free up resources and time for law enforcement, is under fire from Republican state lawmakers.</p>
<p>Rep. Monica Youngblood, a Republican from Albuquerque, opposes decriminalization on the grounds that the state has more pressing concerns.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that people are being arrested or rearrested or that the justice system is being packed with all of these low-level possession crimes,&#8221; she said.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Albuquerque police data shows that a recent 12-month period saw 177 instances of marijuana possession offenses. These arrests and citations consume hours of police time, argued Davis, a former cop himself.</p>
<p>In addition to Democratic lawmakers and the city&#8217;s police union, the people of Albuquerque are in favor of decriminalization. More than 50 percent of voters in all nine city districts <a href="http://www.drugpolicy.org/press-release/2018/03/albuquerque-city-council-files-bill-decriminalize-marijuana-possession" rel="nofollow">voted to decriminalize</a> possession up to an ounce.</p>
<p>Albuquerque lawmakers considering marijuana decriminalization will have to consider this broad coalition of support when they vote on the new proposal.</p>

			<p>A Canadian marijuana company will become the first &#8220;pure play&#8221; cannabis listing on a major U.S. stock market, an important milestone for the cannabis industry.</p>
<p>Cronos Group, one of Canada&#8217;s largest vertically integrated medical marijuana companies, will start trading Tuesday on the Nasdaq Global Market under the symbol CRON. Cronos will maintain its listing on Toronto&#8217;s <a href="https://web.tmxmoney.com/quote.php?qm_symbol=mjn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TSX Venture Exchange</a>.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq, which hasn&#8217;t been shy about <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/nasdaq-rejects-cannabis-companys-listing-application-2016-05-24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rejecting cannabis companies</a>, doesn&#8217;t list any other plant-touching company directly involved in cultivation and sales.</p>
<p>The move by Cronos, based in&#160;Stayner, Ontario, could light a flame for movers of institutional capital in the United States who haven&#8217;t embraced the MMJ industry to the extent that large investors in Canada have, according to analysts.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cannabisbenchmarks.com/annual-review-and-outlook-2017-2018-edition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-66014" src="https://mjbizdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1.png" alt="" width="300"></a>&#8220;It could help to have a U.S.-dollar ticker on an exchange that (American inventors) are comfortable with,&#8221; said Vahan Ajamian, a Toronto-based analyst with Beacon Securities.</p>
<p>&#8220;It could loosen some pockets of U.S. institutional money.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Nasdaq listing also gives U.S. investors easier access to international medical cannabis opportunities through Cronos&#8217; operations in key burgeoning markets in Europe.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is good for exposure. It&#8217;s not that easy for U.S. investors to get access to international cannabis stocks,&#8221; Ajamian said.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Stigma eroding&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>Any headwinds the medical cannabis industry faces from the <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/report-sessions-rescind-cole-memo-creating-cloud-uncertainty-marijuana-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump administration</a> are being offset by growing acceptance of the sector across a broader range of American society.</p>
<p>And the country&#8217;s first &#8220;pure play&#8221; cannabis listing on a major stock exchange is expected to add to that momentum.</p>
<p>&#8220;It shows the stigma is eroding,&#8221; said Mike Gorenstein, president and CEO of Cronos.</p>
<p>&#8220;The more you have mainstream institutions like Nasdaq underwriting and accepting cannabis as a real industry, the better it is for all of us.&#8221;</p>
<p>He said being listed on the same exchange as Apple, Google and Facebook &#8220;adds a layer of legitimacy&#8221; to the entire medical cannabis sector.</p>
<p>Samantha Roman, consultant and founder of Toronto-based Credible Cannabis, said a major U.S. stock market&#8217;s acceptance of a vertically integrated cannabis company is a testament to the level of credibility the industry and Cronos have established.</p>
<p>&#8220;These highly regulated bodies do not make their decisions lightly,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The fact that they have been able to achieve this really does speak to their track record and dealing appropriately with regulators.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>More to follow?</strong></p>
<p>It could be the start of more cannabis corporations seeking listings on top U.S. stock markets, analysts say.</p>
<p>Jason Zandberg, analyst at PI Financial in Vancouver, British Columbia, said Cronos&#8217; move makes it more likely for some high-end vertically integrated medical cannabis companies to make the jump to a top American exchange.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a high hurdle, so not every cannabis company will be able to get a Nasdaq listing,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I think some of the higher-quality names are likely to make the same transition.&#8221;</p>
<p>Zandberg said a company like British Columbia-based Tilray <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/canada-needs-expand-rec-marijuana-products-qa-tilray-ceo-brendan-kennedy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could be a candidate</a>, given that&#160;its parent company is U.S.-based Privateer Holdings.</p>
<p>He noted, however, he doesn&#8217;t have any knowledge of a Tilray plan to go public.</p>
<p><strong>US strategy</strong></p>
<p>Cronos will do business only in markets where medical cannabis is legal at a federal level, so its Nasdaq listing doesn&#8217;t portend imminent expansion into any U.S. state.</p>
<p>But the listing does set the stage if things were to change in Washington DC.</p>
<p>&#8220;When it comes to U.S. market entry, the regulatory landscape can change a lot, and we feel it is heading in the right direction,&#8221; said Gorenstein. &#8220;We&#8217;ll be opportunistic and aggressive.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whether that&#8217;s through acquisitions, partnerships or just a straight-line extension of our own business model, we do think this will give us more awareness, more exposure, and make that transition a success.&#8221;</p>
<p>The U.S. listing is also expected to make mergers and acquisitions easier to negotiate, because the heavier a stock is traded, the more it becomes like cash.</p>
<p>Cronos ultimately believes listing on the Nasdaq gives it more awareness and exposure, which is highly important in a young industry that&#8217;s restricted in advertising.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to give more American investors a chance to get involved with Cronos in these early stages,&#8221; Gorenstein said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Having a strong base will be a big positive when we do ultimately enter (the U.S.).&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is so much controversy about cannabis now,&#8221; said Roe. &#8220;We need to study that drug, like any other drug. Where there are benefits &#8212; if there are any &#8212; then we use it for what it&#8217;s researched for.&#8221;</p>
<p>Roe is an important congressional advocate for veterans&#8217; issues. He is the Chairman of the House Committee on Veterans&#8217; Affairs, as well.</p>
<p>He also said that he will support VA Secretary David Shulkin if he approves cannabis research.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>&#8220;I would support [Shulkin] if he did it. I will make that clear,&#8221; Roe said.</p>
<p>The VA has the ability to study cannabis as medicine better than other bodies tackling the issue, Roe believes.</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need state legislators making medical decisions, we need medical people making medical decisions,&#8221; he told reporters.</p>
<p>Roe and Shulkin are both physicians.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>In Step with Democratic Colleagues</h2>
<p>Roe&#8217;s remarks are similar to those of his colleague, Rep. Tim Walz from Minnesota. Walz is the senior Democratic member of the House Committee on&#160;Veterans&#8217; Affairs.</p>
<p>In October, Walz and other Democrats sent a letter to Shulkin. In it, they asked the secretary to instruct the VA to begin medical marijuana research.</p>
<p>The lawmakers noted that many veterans had contacted them about the issue. The vets&#160;want new options to combat serious medical issues such as chronic pain and PTSD. They also want research into the potential of cannabis to fight opioid addiction.</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;This Veterans&#8217; Affairs Leader Supports Medical Marijuana Research</h2>
<p>The VA is currently authorized to research medical marijuana, according to Shulkin. But VA doctors will have to wait before they start writing prescriptions for their patients. The secretary also attended the American Legion conference and <a href="http://connectingvets.com/articles/will-va-research-marijuana-veterans-we-asked-shulkin-ourselves" rel="nofollow">talked with reporters</a> about medical marijuana.</p>
<p>&#8220;Right, I do believe the VA is now able to do research. There are many, many barriers and steps that one has to take.&#160;But VA, while it takes a long time, is moving forward in some of those research studies.&#160;We have one in Charleston right now that we&#8217;re trying to get approved through the appropriate channels.</p>
<p>I do believe that researching and studying anything that could potentially help our veterans is consistent with our mission and we should be looking at that. But we are going to have to adhere to federal law in terms of prescribing, until a time that law would change.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shulkin said that despite the obstacles, VA research into medical marijuana could begin as soon as this year.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s difficult to do the research, but we are putting in applications, and we&#8217;re committed to studying anything that would potentially help veterans.&#8221;</p>

<hr>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There are over 630,000&#160;</span><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">deaths</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> annually in the United States due to heart disease, which represent nearly a quarter of all deaths. An additional 140,000 deaths result from stroke. Cannabis consumers are used to warnings about the potential damage the drug is doing to their brain, but what about their heart? Could cannabis be affecting our cardiovascular health?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The cardiovascular system is made up of the heart and blood vessels that transport blood throughout your body (the &#8220;cardio&#8221; part of the term refers to the heart, while &#8220;vascular&#8221; refers to the system of blood vessels, veins, and arteries). When the cardiovascular system isn&#8217;t working properly, it can lead to a heart attack where part of the heart muscle dies, or a stroke which is the blockage or rupture of blood vessels that then deprives brain cells of their necessary nutrients and causes them to die.</span></p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/health/how-marijuana-affects-the-brain"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/29202739/how-marijuana-affects-the-brain-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">How Does Cannabis Consumption Affect the Brain?</div></div></a></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In a recent&#160;</span><a href="http://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2670319/associations-between-marijuana-use-cardiovascular-risk-factors-outcomes-systematic-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">meta-analysis</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, researchers scrutinized 24 articles that investigated the impacts of cannabis on cardiovascular risk factors (such as cholesterol levels, obesity rates, and diabetes) and cardiovascular events like stroke and heart attack. They concluded that there&#8217;s insufficient evidence that cannabis use has any effect on heart attacks or stroke, or increases their risk factors. The researchers found some evidence that cannabis use may be associated with </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">lower</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> risk for obesity. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So are cannabis consumers in the clear? Not so fast. The authors note that many of the studies were limited by elevated risk of bias and poor control over cannabis exposure levels and frequency. Also, because levels of the euphoric cannabinoid, <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/what-is-tetrahydrocannabinol">THC</a>, are on the&#160;</span><a href="http://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223(16)00045-7/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">rise</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, it&#8217;s difficult to generalize the effects of cannabis use over the last few decades using today&#8217;s use patterns. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But what caused scientists and physicians to propose a link between cannabis and cardiovascular risk factors in the first place?</span></p>
<h2>Increase in Cannabis-Related Health Complications in the Clinic</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">With the number of cannabis consumers increasing, so have the number of cannabis-related&#160;</span><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs40119-017-0102-x" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">cardiovascular events</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The&#160;</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16168820" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">problem</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that the cannabis consumers showing up in emergency rooms are often young with few other risk factors, leading many to believe that cannabis itself is playing a role.&#160;</span></p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">Most studies looking at the impact of cannabis on cardiovascular health only control for general use patterns&#8211;not type of cannabis.</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One study found that risk of heart attack increases nearly&#160;</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11401936" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">five-fold</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within the hour of using cannabis. Another found that weekly cannabis use more than&#160;</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26558539" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">quadruples</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> stroke risk. You&#8217;d predict then, that if cannabis access increases with legalization, then cardiovascular deaths would go up. Indeed they&#160;</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29227828" target="_blank" rel="noopener">d<span style="font-weight: 400;">o</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and the effect is strongest in states with more lax dispensing regulations. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, that sounds frightening. If it&#8217;s true, how could another&#160;</span><a href="http://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2670319/associations-between-marijuana-use-cardiovascular-risk-factors-outcomes-systematic-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> conclude that there&#8217;s no sufficient evidence for cannabis&#8217; effect on cardiovascular complications?</span></p>
<h2>Variability in Cannabis Type and Use Patterns Makes Studies in Humans Challenging</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Your average dispensary has a massive range of cannabis products available. Some are rich in THC, others are low in THC. Some have high levels of other <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/list-major-cannabinoids-cannabis-effects">cannabinoids</a>, like cannabidiol (CBD), which can have opposite effects on the brain and body as THC. But most studies looking at the impact of cannabis on cardiovascular health only control for general use patterns&#8211;not type of cannabis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The studies usually don&#8217;t control for THC consumption or the presence of other cannabinoids. The larger assessments of the impact of statewide legalization on cardiovascular events in the state&#8217;s population don&#8217;t even assess whether these events occurred in cannabis users, thereby assuming that increased cannabis access is the variable that changed the mortality rate. So when someone says that &#8220;cannabis use&#8221; increases risk for cardiovascular events, the next questions should be: what type of cannabis? And how often are they using? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To better understand the impact of cannabis on the heart and vasculature, let&#8217;s unpack the contribution that the <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/science-tech/what-is-the-endocannabinoid-system">endogenous cannabinoid receptors</a>&#160;type I and II (CB1 and CB2) have on cardiovascular function. </span></p>
<h2>The Impact of CB1 Receptors on Heart Rate and Heart Attack Risk</h2>
<figure id="attachment_58745" style="width: 840px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-large wp-image-58745" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/23105028/Artboard-4-1-1024x641.png" alt="" width="840" height="526" srcset="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/23105028/Artboard-4-1-1024x641.png 1024w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/23105028/Artboard-4-1-300x188.png 300w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/23105028/Artboard-4-1-768x480.png 768w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/23105028/Artboard-4-1-50x31.png 50w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/23105028/Artboard-4-1-1280x800.png 1280w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/23105028/Artboard-4-1-960x600.png 960w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/23105028/Artboard-4-1-480x300.png 480w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/23105028/Artboard-4-1-240x150.png 240w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">THC activates CB1 receptors to decrease blood pressure and increase heart rate. (Elysse Feigenblatt/Leafly)</figcaption></figure>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CB1 receptors are found all over the body&#8217;s cardiovascular system. They&#8217;re on the heart muscle, surround blood vessels, and regulate the brain nerves that control heart rate. So there&#8217;s plenty of reason to believe THC-rich cannabis could impact cardiovascular function.</span></p>
<p><strong>Increased Heart rate</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Activation of CB1 receptors by THC can increase heart rate by 20-50 beats per minute. This increase occurs in order to compensate for the reduction in blood pressure caused by THC. THC increases the diameter of blood vessels, which lowers blood pressure, and forces the heart to work harder in order to pump blood. Some reports find that the heart must work&#160;</span><a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/j.1552-4604.2002.tb06004.x/epdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">30%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> harder in the presence of high levels of THC.</span></p>

<p><strong>Effects on Arteries</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CB1 receptor activation also increases plaque buildup in arteries which increases risk of atherosclerosis, a disease characterized by the narrowing of arteries that can lead to heart attack and stroke. This effect occurs through two main mechanisms. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">First, activating CB1 receptors increases the amount of harmful chemicals called reactive oxygen species, which damage the walls of arteries. The damage to the artery walls initiates an immune response that attracts special immune cells known as macrophages. These macrophages become part of the wall of the artery. This is worsened by a second effect of activating CB1 receptors, which increases the amount of the &#8220;bad&#8221; low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol of the macrophages that adhere to the walls of the artery. This exacerbates the effect that elevated levels of reactive oxygen species have on plaque buildup, increasing risk of heart attack and stroke.</span></p>
<h2>The Effects of CB2 Receptors on Cardiovascular Health</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">While drugs that activate CB1 receptors can have negative effects on cardiovascular health, drugs that selectively activate CB2 receptors have beneficial effects on heart health.</span></p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">Low doses of THC have been shown to reduce plaque buildup and risk for atherosclerosis.</div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">CB2 receptors are mostly expressed in immune cells, but their levels increase in other parts of the body after injury or in disease. Therefore, they&#8217;re not only a good target to reduce the harmful effects of CB1 receptors on heart health, but they can be a promising&#160;</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3481040/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">target</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to lessen the damage caused by injury or cardiovascular attack. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Activating CB2 receptors reduces the inflammation and free radicals that increase plaque buildup in arteries and elevate risk for heart attack and stroke. Through this anti-inflammatory effect, if a heart attack or stroke do occur, activating CB2 receptors reduces the extent of&#160;</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19162037" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">damage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">.</span></p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/health/how-to-stimulate-the-endocannabinoid-system-without-cannabis"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/12143611/stimulating-endocannabinoid-system-without-cannabis-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">How to Stimulate the Endocannabinoid System Without Cannabis</div></div></a></div>
<h2>Is THC Dangerous for Cardiovascular Health?</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The answer depends on the dose. THC can activate both CB1 and CB2 receptors, but low doses of THC appear to most strongly activate&#160;</span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03389" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CB2&#8217;s</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> pro-cardiovascular health effects. At higher doses, THC&#8217;s effect on CB1 receptors overrides its effect on CB2 receptors and has a net negative impact on cardiovascular health. In fact, </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">low doses of THC have been shown to </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature03389" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> plaque buildup and risk for atherosclerosis. This beneficial low-dose effect is thought to come from THC&#8217;s activation of CB2 receptors, and not CB1 receptors, suggesting that THC&#8217;s ability to activate CB2 receptors can protect the heart, while its activation of CB1 receptors can hurt it. &#160;</span></p>
<h2>How Other Cannabinoids Affect Cardiovascular Health</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Two of the most abundant phytocannabinoids other than THC are <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/science-tech/what-does-cbd-do">CBD</a> and tetrahydrocannabivarin (<a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/what-is-thcv-and-what-are-the-benefits-of-this-cannabinoid">THCV</a>). CBD can block THC&#8217;s ability to activate CB1 receptors and could protect against some of the harm caused by the drop in blood pressure and elevated heart rate caused by THC alone. On its own, CBD is a potent <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC20965/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">antioxidant</a> and neutralizes harmful free radicals. It also has strong <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3579247/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anti-inflammatory</a> abilities which can reduce the damage caused by activation of CB1 receptors. Indeed, CBD has beneficial effects on cardiovascular risk factors and improves <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28905873" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recovery</a> in animal models of heart attack and stroke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">THCV has pro-cardiovascular effects by blocking CB1 receptor function at low doses. It&#8217;s through this mechanism that THCV is thought to&#160;</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3671751/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">reduce</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> insulin sensitivity in obese mice, which reduces risk for cardiovascular events. And like CBD, THCV has been shown to be safe in Phase II&#160;</span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27573936" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">clinical</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> trials. THCV becomes an activator of CB1 receptors at high does, but in most strains of cannabis, THCV levels are too low to activate them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite this seemingly bleak picture, cardiovascular events only represent&#160;</span><a href="http://jaha.ahajournals.org/content/3/2/e000638#ref-8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2%</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> of all medical reports related to cannabis. Cannabis&#8217; relationship with cardiovascular health remains unclear and we&#8217;re left inferring its effects from the impacts of THC on its own, or generalizing from the effects of activating CB1 or CB2 receptors in preclinical animal models. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Emerging evidence suggests that cannabis use increases risk for cardiovascular events, but these studies fail to control for THC levels consumed, the presence of additional and often counteracting cannabinoids (e.g., CBD), duration and frequency of use, and consumption method. Regardless of how you interpret the risk, just be sure stay away from synthetic cannabinoids like K2 and Spice&#8211;that junk can kill you.</span></p>

					<p>Watching comedian Lewis Black perform is like being treated to a tasty nougat of released anger and inhibitions. <span id="more-69913"></span>His comedy is in your face and overflowing with curse words. You almost wonder how a man so filled with rage is able to sleep at night.</p>
<p>The answer, it turns out, is marijuana edibles. See, Black is always touring, like most working stand-up comedians. But sleeping in multiple cities a week can disrupt any sleep lover&#8217;s bedtime routines, so Black brings marijuana edibles along for every trip.</p>

<p>Medical <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a> has become a widely accepted tool within the health community, and not just within the human sector. Studies have shown that <a href="https://hightimes.com/culture/pot-for-pets-owners-treat-sick-animals-with-cannabis/">animals, too, can benefit from the healing power of cannabis</a>&#160;as well, and it&#8217;s now starting to become a viable option for veterinarians to utilize. While most animal doctors have yet to harness the power of cannabis, it appears California vets want to prescribe medical marijuana for pets following a&#160;&#160;first-of-its-kind study.</p>
<h2>Pot For Pets</h2>
<p>Jamie Peyton, a veterinarian at the UC Davis Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, has been studying the effects of cannabis on animals over the past few months, with promising results.</p>
<p>The study, which included responses from 1,300 pet owners who have treated their animals with non-psychoactive oils <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/sports-league-accepts-cbd-products/">like CBD</a>, found that the effects of the cannabis helped treat anxiety, pain, nausea in their pets.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is very similar to medical cannabis usage for humans,&#8221; <a href="http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/article201771129.html" rel="nofollow">Peyton said</a>.</p>
<p>However, unlike typical medical doctors in California, it is illegal for veterinarians to prescribe cannabis solutions for pets under state law. But this could soon change with a passing of proposed bill&#160;AB 2215, which would &#8220;protect state-licensed veterinarians from disciplinary action for discussing the use of cannabis on animal patient clients.&#8221; The proposed legislation is sponsored by the California Veterinary Medical Association.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the bill has been mired in controversy. Opponents of the bill believe there&#8217;s too much risk involved, and a potential marijuana &#8216;overdose&#8217; could be toxic to pets. Also holding back the bill is marijuana&#8217;s lingering <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/new-jersey-ordered-review-marijuanas-schedule-classification/">Schedule I status</a>, which has made it difficult to attract funding for additional studies.</p>
<p>Not to mention the bill has met some obstacles early on. During a Wednesday meeting, a motion from the California Veterinary Medical Board to support the bill failed after a 4-2 vote. The bill needed five votes to get the recommendation, which will force&#160;Assemblymember Ash Kalra, the creator of the legislation, to work with the board in order to secure the fifth vote.</p>
<p>However, optimism remains for the bill to eventually be passed. Supporters argue that there is a need for alternative medication along with additional knowledge on the subject. According to Valerie Fenstermaker, the executive director of the Veterinary Medical Associations, doctors are already receiving inquiries regarding medicinal cannabis for their pets.</p>
<p>&#8220;Veterinarians should be making these recommendations, not all these other people,&#8221; said Fenstermaker.&#160; &#8220;Some veterinarians have expressed that they receive questions daily about this.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>Final Hit:&#160;California Vets Want To Prescribe Medical Marijuana For Pets</h2>
<p>Being that California is one of the more <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/california-may-end-workplace-discrimination-marijuana-users/">progressive states when it comes to cannabis</a>, it could only be a matter of time before detractors of AB 2215. Keep in mind, medicinal marijuana was legalized in California back in 1996, and was also met with scrutiny, due to a similar lack of knowledge.</p>
<p>As it stands, there are not many resources for pet owners to learn about the potential benefits of cannabis use. That&#8217;s why this bill is so important.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is nothing out there for them,&#8221; Peyton said. &#8220;Right now, they are on their own.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now that more states are hopping on the legalization train, <a href="https://flavrx.com/" rel="nofollow">Flav</a> wants their clients to know that their extensive line of products isn&#8217;t exclusively for medical marijuana patients. They&#8217;re for everyone looking for a higher quality cannabis experience.</p>
<p>And to add to that,&#160;the company is sweetening the pot even more. We&#8217;re excited to announce that they have expanded their reach even further. Devotees of this dope brand will now be able to buy their products in the following states:</p>
<ul>
<li>California</li>
<li>Washington</li>
<li>Oregon</li>
<li>Michigan</li>
<li>Nevada</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#8217;s also another state we can add to the roster: Arizona. To further stake their claim in the Copper State, the company has revealed that they will be joining Rebelution and showcasing their brand at the Pot of Gold Music Festival in March.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>Flav has also started outreach in Florida and Hawaii. While this is certainly exciting news for residents in those states, it&#8217;s even more thrilling from a broader perspective.</p>
<p>With a presence in eight states, they have distinguished themselves as a cannabis brand that brings its products directly to their clients in more states than any other company. And for good reason.</p>
<p>Their broad geographic reach is a testament to their success as a company&#8212;and as a brand that cannabis connoisseurs can trust.</p>
<h2>High Quality From Coast To Coast</h2>
<div id="attachment_182415" style="max-width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-182415" src="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/flav-formerly-flavrx-dropping-exciting-news-3.jpeg" alt="Flav, Formerly Known As FlavRx, is Dropping Some Exciting News" width="1000" height="750"><p class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fa fa-camera"></i> Flav</p></div>

<p>Legalization in the United States is spreading faster than ever. As such, more and more cannabis companies have been springing up. While sifting through products can be overwhelming, Flav stands out by making it easy. Their range of products gives their clients a ton of options to choose from and the quality of those products keep their clients coming back for more.</p>
<p>The fact that this company has a presence in eight states in the nation speaks for itself. Whether you consume weed recreationally or medicinally, this is a company that you can trust.</p>

<p>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) &#8212; Two Albuquerque city councilors are pushing to decriminalize marijuana possession in cases where a person is caught with an ounce (28 grams) or less, saying their proposal will free up police time and resources to focus on more serious crimes.</p>
<p>Councilors Pat Davis and Isaac Benton announced their proposal Monday to amend Albuquerque&#8217;s criminal code by making low-level pot possession and paraphernalia without a valid medical marijuana referral a citable offense that can come with a $25 ticket but no jail time.</p>
<p>The proposed change &#8212;which still must go before the City Council and mayor for approval &#8212; would add Albuquerque to a growing list of municipalities that have decriminalized possessing pot in small amounts, including Orlando and Pittsburgh. Nine states and Washington, D.C, have already legalized recreational marijuana.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been needed for many years,&#8221; said Emily Kaltenbach, the state director in New Mexico for the Drug Policy Alliance, which has advocated nationally for easing drug sentencing laws. &#8220;New Mexico is sort of behind the curve when it comes to marijuana reform.&#8221;</p>
<p>She added that a single arrest for marijuana possession can hinder a person&#8217;s chances at securing housing or student loans. New Mexico is also among a handful of states where marijuana possession on a person&#8217;s record can block his or her chances of getting approval to adopt a child, she said.</p>
<p>Under the city&#8217;s criminal code now, police can issue $50 fines to first-time offenders possessing an ounce or less of marijuana. Authorities can also decide to send the first-time offenders to jail for a maximum of 15 days, though such instances appear to be rare. The fines and penalties increase with a second violation.</p>
<p>A review of Metropolitan Detention Center bookings over the past week showed no one was booked into the jail following an Albuquerque police arrest on a sole petty misdemeanor charge of paraphernalia or marijuana possession. Bernalillo County Sheriff&#8217;s deputies only made one such arrest in Albuquerque resulting in a jail booking in Albuquerque in the same period.</p>
<p>The low rate of arrests has raised some question from skeptics, including Rep. Monica Youngblood, an Albuquerque Republican, over the proposal&#8217;s impact. As a state lawmaker, she expressed opposition to legalizing marijuana in the past, saying she believes the state has bigger problems to address.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that people are being arrested or rearrested or that the justice system is being packed with all of these low-level possession crimes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see that it&#8217;s an issue or something we should be concerned about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Citing Albuquerque police data, Davis, a former law enforcement officer and Democrat, said that in a recent 12-month period there were 177 instances in which marijuana possession was listed as the top offense. Each arrest or citation was likely to have resulted in potentially hours of police time to process.</p>
<p>In 2015, a similar proposal went before the City Council, but was vetoed by Mayor Richard Berry, a Republican. Berry was replaced late last year by Tim Keller, a Democrat.</p>
<p>Davis said he believes the proposal&#8217;s prospects have been boosted by the change in administrations.</p>
<p>The measure also has backing from the city&#8217;s police union.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re a dispensary owner interviewing new employees, you&#8217;ll ask them about a lot of things. Why they&#8217;re interested in working in the cannabis industry, maybe, or what&#8217;s their experience with the products. Perhaps you even offer a pop quiz to see what they&#8217;d recommend to a hypothetical customer.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because dispensary employees should have one job always at the top of their mind: helping their customers find the very best cannabis product for their individual needs, whether it&#8217;s a topical gel for managing aches and pains, an oil cartridge to help keep their consumption inconspicuous, or a pre-roll to share with friends.</p>

<p>But that can be hard to do when they&#8217;re trying to manage a stable of different technologies. To manage inventory, they&#8217;re using one piece of software. To complete a transaction with a customer? There&#8217;s another. And if you&#8217;re in a medical-only state and need to manage compliance? There&#8217;s number three.</p>
<p>Every second a budtender is thinking about which piece of software to use is a second that they&#8217;re not handling their number one priority: making sure customers have the best possible experience. For dispensary owners, the answer may be simplicity itself&#8212;as in simplifying the point-of-sale experience with an inclusive system like <a rel="nofollow" href="https://indicaonline.com/">IndicaOnline</a>.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/industry/why-you-should-integrate-your-menu-with-your-pos-system"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/15133639/integrating-pos-system-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">The Benefits of POS System and Dispensary Menu Integration</div></div></a></div>
<h2>One Software to Rule Them All</h2>
<p>Moving between pieces of software doesn&#8217;t just slow down transactions and distract staffers. It also maximizes the opportunities for something to go wrong in a transaction, from missed bar code scans to hardware hiccups caused by switching between programs.</p>
<p>Instead, when you&#8217;re managing every aspect of your business through one system, there&#8217;s less room for mistakes. That&#8217;s why many dispensary owners have moved to do-it-all systems like IndicaOnline, which let them make sales and manage inventory from a single piece of familiar software.</p>
<p>IndicaOnline can also help business owners manage other issues both inside their dispensary and on the road. The IndicaOnlineTV feature makes it simple to manage in-store digital signage, displaying up-to-date menus, social media feeds, special sales, and more, depending on the store&#8217;s needs that day. For dispensaries that offer delivery options, Dispatcher Mode provides tools to help managers track couriers, transactions, and cash collections from the same interface.</p>

<h2>Built With Input From Cannabis Professionals</h2>
<p>Ease of use was a high priority for the development team at IndicaOnline, which made it their goal to craft a piece of software that could do everything, and do it simply. To do that, they worked with business owners and professionals from around the cannabis industry to learn what problems they saw, and work to address them with a single solution.</p>
<p>&#8220;We took the time to collaborate with dispensary owners and staff members to identify common issues that occur at the point-of-sale, such as smart order pricing,&#8221; says IndicaOnline developer Vladimir Prokhorov. &#8220;We designed our software interface with solutions to these obstacles in mind to create a user-friendly point-of-sale system that is both comprehensive and intuitive.&#8221;</p>
<p>Conversations like these helped guide the development of some of IndicaOnline&#8217;s most useful features. Tools such as automatic syncing of sales data to state reporting systems and monitoring of customers to make sure they stay below purchase limits makes it easy for dispensary owners to stay in compliance with state laws and regulations, no matter where they do business.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/industry/6-strategies-selling-excess-cannabis-product-inventory"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/04114419/sales-strategies-excess-inventory-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">6 Strategies for Selling Excess Cannabis Product Inventory</div></div></a></div>
<p>Another thing business owners told IndicaOnline&#8217;s developers: no matter where they are, they&#8217;re working. That means that whether they&#8217;re visiting a producer, at a conference, or just tucked the kids in for the night, they need unfettered access to data about their stores. Whatever you&#8217;re doing and wherever it takes you, the mobile app lets you mind the shop as if you were right in the office.</p>

<h2>Hardware and Software, Together</h2>
<p>Whether it&#8217;s a dispensary or a deli, everyone in retail has had to deal with hardware issues like a jammed printer or a finicky set of cables. That&#8217;s why IndicaOnline also offers POS hardware that&#8217;s as easy to use as their software.</p>
<p>The basic register kit includes built-in tools like a barcode scanner and receipt printer. It&#8217;s also modular, with the option to add helpful tools like digital scales, ID card swiper, and other tools to make sure that your budtenders have everything they need right at hand.</p>
<p>And of course, the IndicaOnline hardware and software are designed to work in concert for the smoother experience for customer and employees alike.</p>

(AP) &#8212; Two Albuquerque city councilors are pushing to decriminalize marijuana possession in cases where a person is caught with an ounce (28 grams) or less, saying their proposal will free up police time and resources to focus on more serious crimes.<br>
</p>
<div id="leafly-dfp-ad-widget-mobile-medium-rectangle-126552610" class="leafly-dfp-ad-container">    </div>
<p>Councilors Pat Davis and Isaac Benton announced their proposal Monday to amend Albuquerque&#8217;s criminal code by making low-level cannabis possession and paraphernalia without a valid medical marijuana referral a citable offense that can come with a $25 ticket but no jail time.</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">The measure also has backing from the city''s police union.</div>
<p>The proposed change &#8212;which still must go before the City Council and mayor for approval &#8212; would add Albuquerque to a growing list of municipalities that have decriminalized possessing cannabis in small amounts, including Orlando and Pittsburgh. Nine states and Washington, D.C, have already legalized adult-use marijuana.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been needed for many years,&#8221; said Emily Kaltenbach, the state director in New Mexico for the Drug Policy Alliance, which has advocated nationally for easing drug sentencing laws. &#8220;New Mexico is sort of behind the curve when it comes to marijuana reform.&#8221;</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/new-mexicos-new-legalization-bill-is-shockingly-good-too-bad-it-wont-pass"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01144654/new-mexico-adult-use-bill-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">New Mexico&#8217;s New Legalization Bill Is Shockingly Good. Too Bad It Won&#8217;t Pass.</div></div></a></div>
<p>She added that a single arrest for marijuana possession can hinder a person&#8217;s chances at securing housing or student loans. New Mexico is also among a handful of states where marijuana possession on a person&#8217;s record can block his or her chances of getting approval to adopt a child, she said.</p>
<p>Under the city&#8217;s criminal code now, police can issue $50 fines to first-time offenders possessing an ounce or less of marijuana. Authorities can also decide to send the first-time offenders to jail for a maximum of 15 days, though such instances appear to be rare. The fines and penalties increase with a second violation.</p>
<p>A review of Metropolitan Detention Center bookings over the past week showed no one was booked into the jail following an Albuquerque police arrest on a sole petty misdemeanor charge of paraphernalia or marijuana possession. Bernalillo County Sheriff&#8217;s deputies only made one such arrest in Albuquerque resulting in a jail booking in Albuquerque in the same period.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/new-mexico-considers-lower-penalties-for-cannabis-possession"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/24164027/new-mexico-decrim-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">New Mexico Considers Lower Penalties for Cannabis Possession</div></div></a></div>
<p>The low rate of arrests has raised some question from skeptics, including Rep. Monica Youngblood, an Albuquerque Republican, over the proposal&#8217;s impact. As a state lawmaker, she expressed opposition to legalizing marijuana in the past, saying she believes the state has bigger problems to address.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see that people are being arrested or rearrested or that the justice system is being packed with all of these low-level possession crimes,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t see that it&#8217;s an issue or something we should be concerned about.&#8221;</p>
<p>Citing Albuquerque police data, Davis, a former law enforcement officer and Democrat, said that in a recent 12-month period there were 177 instances in which marijuana possession was listed as the top offense. Each arrest or citation was likely to have resulted in potentially hours of police time to process.</p>

<p>The legal <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> industry is still figuring itself out as it goes. Right now, the movers and shakers of the industry are still laying the foundation. What shape do we want the weed industry to take? Who should be the leaders of this new industry? Should doctors take over the cannabis industry? Alternatively, should we look at it as strictly a business venture dominated by businesspeople? Or something else entirely?</p>
<h2>Should Doctors Take Over the Cannabis Industry?</h2>

<p>One idea that&#8217;s been floating around is that doctors and healthcare providers should become key leaders in the industry. A pharmacist in Alberta, Canada explained some of the thought processes behind this idea.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have done extensive education and study researching it so that we&#8217;re aware of what&#8217;s happening,&#8221; Greg Bueckert said in an interview with <a href="http://chatnewstoday.ca/article/548725/pharmacist-says-he-wants-help-patients-when-marijuana-legalized" rel="nofollow">Chat News Today</a>.</p>
<p>As Bueckert pointed out, doctors are involved in the process of <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/medical-marijuana/where-are-all-the-medical-marijuana-doctors/">talking to patients</a> about the effects of weed. Already, they&#8217;re the ones making recommendations and prescriptions in states that have legalized medical marijuana programs. Given all this, it makes sense to let doctors maintain this central role.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>Additionally, Bueckert said that doctors have a key role to play beyond learning about and explaining to people the effects of weed.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re concerned with health, and that&#8217;s with everything people consume, whether it&#8217;s licensed drugs or otherwise,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>It seems clear that no matter what happens, doctors will be important players in the overall weed industry. In many ways, doctors serve as the link between medical research and cannabis consumers. Doctors end up playing key educational roles, communicating to people what the current research says about weed.</p>
<h2>A Well-Rounded Industry</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-182396 aligncenter" src="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/doctors-take-cannabis-industry-2.jpg" alt="Should Doctors Take Over The Cannabis Industry?" width="1000" height="600"></p>
<p>While doctors and healthcare providers will probably always be crucial players in the weed industry, should doctors take over the cannabis industry? Probably not. That would end up limiting the industry and would make it too narrowly focused only on medicinal uses.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>At this point, it seems that the young cannabis industry should be working toward being as well-rounded as possible. Along with doctors, that&#160;would also include a much broader range of people.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://hightimes.com/study/federal-marijuana-research-evolved/">researchers</a>. Doctors try to stay up to date on research, but they&#8217;re not actually doing that research. For that reason, the legal weed industry needs to remain closely linked to <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/canadian-government-funding-marijuana-research/">a broad range of scholars and researchers</a> who can expand our understanding of all aspects of cannabis.</p>
<p>Similarly, the industry needs people who are tapped into other elements of cannabis and cannabis culture. Obviously, the industry needs a strong group of breeders and <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/will-emerald-triangles-small-growers-survive-legalization/">growers</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, business-minded folks should play important roles in helping distribute and sell cannabis products. Additionally, people like <a href="https://hightimes.com/edibles/weed-edibles-and-cannabis-chefs-popping-up-at-food-festivals/">chefs</a>, artists, and inventors play key roles in creatively pushing the cannabis scene in new directions.</p>
<p>There are also pressing questions about law, business practices, <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/legalization/are-municipal-banks-the-answer-to-the-cannabis-industrys-cash-problems/">finances</a>, agriculture, <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/cannasure-launches-insurance-program-weed-businesses/">insurance</a>,&#160;<a href="https://hightimes.com/news/marijuana-farming-hurt-environment/">environmental impact</a>, and much, much more. A strong industry will incorporate people from each of these fields.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentC -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc article_middleContentC dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>The main point is that a strong and vibrant cannabis industry needs <a href="https://hightimes.com/business/competition-and-opportunity-finding-your-place-in-the-emerging-cannabis-industry/">tons of different people</a>, each of whom brings a different perspective, different ways of thinking, and different priorities.&#160;This will help ensure that the industry doesn&#8217;t grow stagnant or doesn&#8217;t simply become another monopolized commodity. A more dynamic, multi-faceted industry will hopefully keep weed from becoming the next Big Tobacco or Big Pharma.</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;Should Doctors Take Over The Cannabis Industry?</h2>
<p>The question of who should lead the weed industry isn&#8217;t just about professional fields. The final&#8212;and arguably most important&#8212;piece of the puzzle is ensuring that the cannabis industry is as diverse as the population of people who actually consume weed.</p>
<p>To put it simply, that means ensuring that the industry isn&#8217;t taken over by rich white men.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, this is already happening. A recent <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/chart-19-cannabis-businesses-owned-founded-racial-minorities/" rel="nofollow">survey</a> of cannabis business owners found that 81 percent of all marijuana business owners are white.</p>
<p>And that number probably fails to reflect how white-dominated the industry really is. That&#8217;s because the survey counts a person with &#8220;any ownership stake in a business, not necessarily a controlling stake&#8221; as an &#8220;owner.&#8221; As a result, a company in which only 10 percent is owned by a black person and 90 percent is owned by white people would still register in the survey as a business with a <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/legalization/how-3-black-visionaries-are-bringing-the-hood-into-the-weed-industry/">black owner</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, the cannabis industry appears to be going through some troubling changes when it comes to gender. <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Women-and-Minorities-Report.pdf" rel="nofollow">Recent stats</a> show that in 2015, 36 percent of all cannabis businesses had <a href="https://hightimes.com/culture/women-rising-high-in-the-cannabis-industry/">women executives</a>. Last year, that number had fallen to 26.9 percent.</p>
<p>Fortunately, even 2017&#8217;s lower number is still higher than the number of women executives across all U.S. businesses, which is around 23 percent. But it is not a good sign that the percentage of women-run weed businesses has dropped so dramatically.</p>
<p>So, who should run the cannabis industry? Anybody and everybody. People of all demographics and professions use weed. And the industry should reflect that diversity. Otherwise, we will waste the revolutionary potential of cannabis. And rich white men will turn weed into just another commodity to make them richer.</p>

<p>BOISE, Idaho (AP) &#8212; A proposal to legalize oil extracted from cannabis plants is likely dead for the year after a group of lawmakers on Monday broke out in turmoil during a last-minute attempt to advance the bill.</p>
<p>Republican Sen. Tony Potts asked the Senate Health and Welfare Committee to give HB 577 a hearing after supporters of the bill said they were being blocked by legislative leaders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we have to remember that we represent people, people who vote for us, people who are our friends,&#8221; Potts said, who was appointed to the Idaho Falls&#8217; legislative seat in October. &#8220;If you&#8217;re constituents are anything like mine, there is a large amount of individuals who desire the health benefits of this (CBD oil).&#8221;</p>
<p>Cannabidiol, otherwise known as CBD oil, comes from cannabis but contain little or no THC. Supporters tout CBDs as a supplement that can help alleviate pain, reduce stress and improve skin health, although there&#8217;s little data on whether they work or what kind of side effects they might have.</p>
<p>Under HB 577, Idahoans seeking to use the oil for medical purposes for themselves or their minor children would have to apply to the Idaho Board of Pharmacy for a cannabidiol registration card.</p>
<p>While Potts defended his motion &#8212; which focused on his recent child&#8217;s seizures and why his family would want to use the product &#8212; he was quickly gaveled down by Chairman Lee Heider.</p>
<p>&#8220;If anyone on this committee wants to talk about this, they can do so in my office,&#8221; Heider said.</p>
<p>The majority of the panel then headed toward Heider&#8217;s office to discuss Potts&#8217; motion.</p>
<p>Heider denied a request by The Associated Press, who followed lawmakers into the office, to sit in on the meeting.</p>
<p>Yells could be heard from multiple members inside Heider&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>&#8220;The governor&#8217;s office doesn&#8217;t want this bill, the prosecutors don&#8217;t want this bill, the office on drug policy doesn&#8217;t want this bill,&#8221; Heider said, who could be heard shouting to his members by the AP on the other side of the door.</p>
<p>Idaho lawmakers passed legislation in 2015 that would have allowed children with severe forms of epilepsy to use CBD oil. That bill was vetoed by Republican Gov. C.L. &#8220;Butch&#8221; Otter, who received pressure from law enforcement groups that feared it would lead to further loosening of the state&#8217;s drug laws. Otter has since said his position has not changed in the past three years.</p>
<p>Heider also warned Potts that his motion was unusual and should not have been made. Other lawmakers could be heard defending the legislative process, while others argued to allow Potts&#8217; motion to be debated.</p>
<p>The committee only broke up after being warned by a reporter that their actions were breaking the state&#8217;s Open Meeting Law.</p>
<p>According to Senate rules, &#8220;all meetings of any standing, select, or special committee shall be open to the public at all times.&#8221;</p>
<p>Once broken up, members returned to the public committee room and a separate motion was made to hold HB 577 in committee &#8212; a legislative procedure essentially halting the bill from moving forward.</p>
<p>&#8220;The concern with the motion that I have, it doesn&#8217;t get it where we need to be,&#8221; Potts said, before voting against the action.</p>
<p>Potts&#8217; concerns were overruled by other members on the committee via a voice vote and HB 577 will likely not advance this legislative session.</p>
<p>The measure had already cleared the House with a veto-proof majority.</p>
<p>Currently, 18 states allow use of &#8220;low THC, high cannabidiol (CBD)&#8221; products for medical reasons in limited situations or as a legal defense.</p>

<p>History seems to be repeating itself in Boise, where a bill to legalize <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/cannabidiol-cbd/">CBD</a> oil in Idaho has been stalled. Talks over HB 577, which would allow registered patients to obtain cannabidiol, broke down in a hearing on Monday. The tumultuous events culminated in a motion to hold the bill in committee, a decision that effectively halts any progress on the bill for the remainder of the year.</p>
<h2>Frozen In Place</h2>
<p>This isn&#8217;t the first time Idaho lawmakers have attempted to legalize CBD oil. In 2015, Idaho legislators passed a bill allowing children with severe forms of epilepsy to use <a href="https://hightimes.com/sponsored/make-sure-cbd-oil-legal-high-quality/">CBD oil</a>.</p>
<p>But the incumbent governor, Republican C.L. &#8220;Butch&#8221; Otter, vetoed the bill under pressure from law enforcement groups.</p>
<p>The veto effectively <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/cbd/how-idahos-drug-warriors-robbed-epileptic-children-of-their-only-hope-cbd-oil/">robbed epileptic children</a> of access to safe, effective medicine. Since the veto, Otter has repeatedly stated that his position remains unchanged.</p>
<p>On Monday, Republican state senator Tony Potts requested a hearing for HB 577 before the Senate Health and Welfare Committee. Potts&#8217; request came after the bill&#8217;s supporters said leaders in the state legislature were stonewalling them.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

		</div>

<p>HB 577 passed the Idaho House of Representatives on February 28 with a vote of 59-11. A week ago, it seemed <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/idaho-getting-closer-legalizing-medical-cannabis/">a vote in the Senate was likely</a>. Now, however, it&#8217;s unlikely the Senate will vote on the bill this year.</p>
<p>This turn of events is no doubt a setback for supporters of the bill. The 59-11 House vote meant the bill had a veto-proof majority.</p>
<p>All it needed to pass was a majority vote in the Senate. And the fact that the bill came so close to passing likely accounts for the turmoil that broke out when Potts requested the hearing.</p>
<h2>After Turmoil In The Legislature, A Bill To Legalize CBD Oil In Idaho Has Been Stalled For The Rest Of The Year</h2>
<p>&#8220;I think we have to remember that we represent people, people who vote for us, people who are our friends. If your constituents are anything like mine, there is a large amount of individuals who desire the <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/cbd/cbd-oil-sales-skyrocket-united-kingdom/">health benefits of CBD oil,</a>&#8221; Potts <a href="http://www.postregister.com/articles/news-todays-headlines/2018/03/06/senate-panel-kills-bill-allowing-use-cbd-oil" rel="nofollow">said</a> on Monday. Sen. Potts has a closer connection to the issue than most. His child suffers from seizures and his family wants to <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil/">use CBD oil to treat them</a>.</p>
<p>But Potts&#8217; motion was struck down by committee Chairman Lee Heider, R-Twin Falls. Heider appeared so distressed at the request, that he demanded the conversation move to his office.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Heider then denied requests by reporters with The Associated Press to sit in on the discussion. But according to the AP, reporters could <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/idaho/articles/2018-03-05/senate-panel-kills-bill-allowing-use-of-marijuana-derivative" rel="nofollow">hear Heider yelling</a> at fellow committee members through the door.</p>
<p>&#8220;The governor&#8217;s office doesn&#8217;t want this bill, the prosecutors don&#8217;t want this bill, the office on drug policy doesn&#8217;t want this bill,&#8221; Heider said. Other state lawmakers could be heard defending Potts&#8217; motion and calling for a debate.</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;A Bill To Legalize CBD Oil In Idaho Has Been Stalled</h2>
<p>Eventually, reporters reminded lawmakers that their closed-door meeting was breaking Idaho&#8217;s Open Meeting Law. Once committee members returned to the public meeting room, legislators voted yes on a motion to hold HB 577 in committee, overruling Potts.</p>
<p>As a result, it&#8217;s extremely unlikely that HB 577 will make any progress during this legislative session. Par for the course in one of the most stridently anti-cannabis states in the country.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-181892" src="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-1.jpg" alt="The Countries With The Most Relaxed Weed Laws" width="2700" height="1800" srcset="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-1.jpg 1000w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-1-100x67.jpg 100w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-1-360x240.jpg 360w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-1-1440x960.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 2700px) 100vw, 2700px"></p>
<p>It is illegal to grow, consume, and sell marijuana in Argentina. But, they make our list because Argentina is the first country to provide medical marijuana&#8230;for free.</p>
<p>In March of last year, the Argentinian Congress passed a <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/argentine-senate-approves-medical-use-of-cannabis-oil/">bill</a> that gives patients registered with the Ministry of Health access to free medical marijuana.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Additionally, as of a 2009 Supreme Court ruling, the police cannot arrest for marijuana possession. They decreed that to do so would be in violation of the constitution.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/argentine-senate-approves-medical-use-of-cannabis-oil/">Valeria Salech,</a> president of the pro-marijuana group Mama Cultiva Argentina, explains, <span class="s1">&#8220;In history, the big things always come in small steps.&#8221;<br>
</span></p>
<h2>2. Uruguay</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-181893" src="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-2.jpg" alt="The Countries With The Most Relaxed Weed Laws" width="3333" height="2222" srcset="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-2.jpg 1000w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-2-100x67.jpg 100w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-2-360x240.jpg 360w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-2-1440x960.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 3333px) 100vw, 3333px"></p>
<p>In 2013, Uruguay became the <a href="https://hightimes.com/grow/uruguayans-now-allowed-to-grow-marijuana/">first country to legalize marijuana</a> for people 18 years and older. The law mandates that you <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/uruguay-opens-registry-to-buy-marijuana/">register</a> with the government to buy and grow marijuana, and open a marijuana club.</p>
<p>A government-issued permit allows for six cannabis plants, and clubs can have a maximum of 45 members. Growers can cultivate up to 99 marijuana plants at a time.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>These lenient cannabis laws, on a national level, make Uruguay one of the countries with the most relaxed weed laws.</p>
<p>The government is heavily involved in weed legislation and sales in Uruguay. Finally, in 2017, 16 pharmacies across Uruguay began selling pot <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/legal-marijuana-sales-begin-in-uruguay-under-landmark-2013-law/">commercially</a>.</p>
<p>Though customers still have to register with the government, Uruguay has lead the way for <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/uruguay-marks-first-legal-cannabis-harvest/">marijuana freedom</a>.</p>
<p>Following its <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/uruguay-marks-first-legal-cannabis-harvest/">first legal harvest</a> last year, Uruguay&#8217;s marijuana legalization proves that there are essentially no ramifications to violating international drug treaties.</p>
<p>This will encourage other nations to follow suit.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>3. Jamaica</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-181894" src="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-3.jpg" alt="The Countries With The Most Relaxed Weed Laws" width="5760" height="3840" srcset="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-3.jpg 1000w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-3-100x67.jpg 100w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-3-360x240.jpg 360w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-3-768x512.jpg 768w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-3-1440x960.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 5760px) 100vw, 5760px"></p>
<p>Perhaps the first country you think of when weed is on the mind, Jamaica has a complicated history with its favorite herb.</p>
<p>Marijuana made its first appearance in Jamaica in the mid-1800s when indentured servants from India imported it, and introduced African workers to marijuana.</p>
<p>Over time, cannabis became a symbol of rebellion against the British. As a result, wealthy lawmakers made cannabis consumption, sale, and growth illegal under the aptly-titled Ganja Law of 1913.</p>
<p>Punishments for marijuana became more severe during periods of social upheaval in the 20th century.</p>
<p>As of 2015, marijuana is decriminalized in Jamaica. You can have up to 2 ounces and five marijuana plants without arrest or mark on your criminal record.</p>
<p>Under this new law, if you&#8217;re a <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/rastafarian-pot-farm-shootout-sparks-religious-use-debate/">Rastafarian</a> in Jamaica, you are legally allowed to use as much of it as you&#8217;d like.</p>
<p>Though weed isn&#8217;t technically legal in Jamaica, it&#8217;s pretty easy to get your hands on it. Authorities are even trying to make it legal to purchase (up to two ounces) in <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/laws/jamaica-wants-tourists-to-buy-weed-in-airports/">airports</a>!</p>
<h2>4. Portugal</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-181895" src="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-4.jpg" alt="The Countries With The Most Relaxed Weed Laws"></p>
<p>Portugal is definitely one of the countries with the most relaxed weed laws after decriminalizing all drugs in 2001.</p>
<p>Why such a drastic measure? Since the &#8217;80s, Portugal has struggled with widespread addiction. At one point, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2017/dec/05/portugals-radical-drugs-policy-is-working-why-hasnt-the-world-copied-it" rel="nofollow">1 in 10 people</a> were addicted to heroin.</p>
<p>Today, punishments for possession of any illegal substance range from a fine to addiction treatment.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.cato.org/publications/white-paper/drug-decriminalization-portugal-lessons-creating-fair-successful-drug-policies" rel="nofollow">study</a> published by the Cato Institute shows that though drug use hasn&#8217;t gone down since decriminalization, death and illness due to drug use has decreased dramatically.</p>
<p>However, don&#8217;t let Portugal&#8217;s liberal policies towards hard drug use mislead you. Selling or growing cannabis in any quantity can still land you jail time or a fine.</p>
<h2>5. Spain</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-181896" src="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-5.jpg" alt="The Countries With The Most Relaxed Weed Laws" width="6603" height="4402" srcset="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-5.jpg 1000w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-5-100x67.jpg 100w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-5-360x240.jpg 360w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-5-768x512.jpg 768w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-5-1440x960.jpg 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 6603px) 100vw, 6603px"></p>
<p>Today, northern Spain may be more lit than Amsterdam. Just north of Morocco, one of the world&#8217;s leading cannabis producers, Spain is <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/has-spain-become-europes-marijuana-garden-experts-say-si/">flush with green</a>.</p>
<p>And, having experienced the same drug epidemic as Portugal, Spain has enacted laws that are far from strict when it comes to Mary J.</p>
<p>Nationally, individual use of marijuana is legal. As a result,&#160; cannabis smoking clubs have become intensely popular. As of 2016, there were a reported <a href="https://hightimes.com/culture/spains-smokers-clubs-on-the-rise-as-legislation-catches-up-with-reality/">800 smoking clubs.</a></p>
<p>In a historic popular movement, these clubs became <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/in-new-challenge-to-madrid-catalonia-legalizes-cannabis/">legal</a> in the northern region of Catalonia in 2017.</p>
<p>After gaining over 67,500 signatures, activist group La Rosa Verda forced Catalonian parliament to vote on legalizing recreational marijuana.</p>
<p>Though this was a huge victory of marijuana activists, many believe that Catalonia&#8217;s legalization program is a thinly veiled rebellion against the national seat of power: Madrid.</p>
<h2>6. The Netherlands</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-181897" src="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-6.jpg" alt="The Countries With The Most Relaxed Weed Laws"></p>
<p>It may come as a surprise that weed is illegal in the Netherlands.</p>
<p>In 1972, the Dutch government developed a tolerant policy that decriminalized marijuana and allows for its consumption in coffee shops. Until last year, though, authorities punished weed cultivation, despite the demand from legal coffee shops.</p>
<p>In 2017, <span class="s1">Dutch Parliament passed a <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/dutch-lawmakers-extend-tolerance-to-cultivating-cannabis/">bill</a> that would partially legalize growing and would be more tolerant of weed smoking. </span></p>
<p><span class="s1">This bill would by no means safeguard smokers across the country. It would mark an important step in legalization in a country already known for its (sometimes hypocritical) tolerance. </span></p>
<h2>7. Colombia</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-181898" src="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-7.jpg" alt="The Countries With The Most Relaxed Weed Laws"></p>
<p>To the chagrin of those living in Colombia, this nation is infamous for its drug history. Throughout the &#8217;70s and &#8217;80s, the drug trade grew in Colombia to such an extent that it accounted for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/ad/cocainenomics" rel="nofollow">80% </a>of the United States&#8217; cocaine supply.</p>
<p>The Medell&#237;n Cartel, run by drug lord Pablo Escobar, made $4 billion a year through the murderous international cocaine.</p>
<p>Much has changed in Colombia since Pablo Escobar&#8217;s death in 1993.</p>
<p>Following its fraught drug history, Colombia developed more tolerant legislation than the ineffective, and corrupt, War on Drugs policy of the late 20th century.</p>
<p>In 2009, the Colombian court decriminalized possession of up to 20 grams of marijuana and 1 gram of cocaine.</p>
<p>Though sale and cultivation of marijuana remain illegal in Colombia, this nation&#8217;s tolerant attitude and experience with the deadly consequences of illegal drug trade make it one of the countries with the most relaxed weed laws, especially in South America.</p>
<h2>8. Australia</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-181899" src="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/countries-relaxed-weed-laws-8.jpg" alt="The Countries With The Most Relaxed Weed Laws"></p>
<p>Similar to the disparities on the state level in the US, marijuana legalization is a <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/will-australia-become-biggest-world-cannabis-exporter/">mixed bag</a> in Australia.</p>
<p>Since early 2016, medical marijuana is <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/legalization/australia-legalizes-medical-marijuana/">legal</a> on a federal level. Australia has also been a pioneer in medical marijuana research, such as this <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/australia-launches-study-medical-marijuana-tourette-syndrome/">study</a> on using medical marijuana as a treatment for Tourette&#8217;s syndrome.</p>
<p>Of course, recreational marijuana remains illegal on the national level. Possession is, however, decriminalized in a majority of Australian states.</p>
<p>Australia prepares to take a big leap in the production of medical marijuana by <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/will-australia-become-biggest-world-cannabis-exporter/">legalizing the export</a> of medical-grade cannabis.</p>
<p>This announcement, made by the Australian government on January 4th of this year, made Australian cannabis company stocks skyrocket.</p>
<p>Many are speculating that Australia will become the world&#8217;s <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/will-australia-become-biggest-world-cannabis-exporter/">biggest cannabis exporter</a>, and help Australians&#8212;and people around the world&#8212;gain access to quality medical marijuana.</p>
<h2>Final Hit: The Countries With The Most Relaxed Weed Laws</h2>
<p>Whether due to a fraught history with the drug trade or simply a less corrupt political process, the countries with the most relaxed weed laws are turning the tide for marijuana legalization everywhere.</p>
<p>As scientific research discovers more <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/can-medical-marijuana-benefit-people-autism/">benefits to medical marijuana</a> and personal experience reminds us how good the green really is, we look forward to more nations joining this esteemed list.</p>

<p>The measure was approved Tuesday on a 37-12 vote and previously passed the House. But because changes were made in the Senate, the House must still sign off on the measure, or seek to negotiate the details further.</p>
<p>Cannabidiol, commonly referred to as CBD oil, is derived from marijuana and hemp, but lacks the stuff that gets people high.</p>
<p>A law passed last year allowed those with a severe form of epilepsy to use the substance. Now lawmakers are going further, following an unexpected crackdown on CBD sales and widespread confusion over whether the product was actually legal.</p>

Our Kins Community is really beginning to come together.&#8221; In anticipation of planting to begin during the spring, 300 acres have been fenced, 16 overnight trailer park sites are under construction, and six 40&#215;40-ft organic vegetable gardens are ready for seasonal planting, according to Jory. As for the 6 geodesic domes mentioned in an earlier press release, 1 is structurally complete with only the electrical and plumbing to be completed. The rest are on site awaiting final site plan approval. &#8220;We are now accepting volunteers who have expressed an interest in helping to build the first Kins Community for our veterans,&#8221; said Jory. Those interested in making the first hemp growing CBD-producing &#8220;Veteran Village Kins Community&#8221; become a reality should contact Ms. Sandra Williams via email (swilliams@hempinc.com).</p>

											    	<h4>John Waters</h4>
<p>John Waters is the unequivocal American Artist of the 21st Century. His style and personality is part Little Richard, part vaudeville illusionist. No stranger to performance, Waters has been producing art for over sixty years. His first performances began on a stage in his parents&#8217; living room when he was eight. By the age of twelve, he was a puppeteer. Waters has produced just about every visual art form imaginable, and is best known for cult flicks like <em>Pink Flamingos</em> and <em>Desperate Living</em> to more mainstream films such as <em>Cry-Baby</em> and <em>A Dirty Shame</em>. His film <em>Hairspray</em> was not only a major motion picture success, it was also turned into a hit Broadway musical.</p>
<div class="flex-video widescreen youtube"><iframe width="1170" height="658" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/limxdheEmmA?feature=oembed&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>But like any great mixed media, multidisciplinary artist, his talents are not limited to one category. Waters has written and directed over fifteen films and acted in over a dozen films and television shows, not including his appearances on late-night TV and in various documentaries. He&#8217;s written six books, which he also does the audiobook readings for; one of his most recent novels, <em>Carsick</em>, was (loosely) based on his actual hitchhiking experience while in his sixties. Waters is also an acclaimed photographer and stand-up comedian who has consistently taken his one-man show across the country. He&#8217;s now added a spoken-word vinyl recording to his repertoire.</p>
<p>Waters&#8217; first spoken-word vinyl record, <em>Make Trouble</em>, is through Jack White&#8217;s Third Man Records. &#8220;I met Jack before, and I&#8217;m a fan,&#8221; Waters notes. &#8220;We&#8217;ve talked. I think the promoters from my Christmas tour were dealing with him and they asked me if I wanted to do this record, and I love the idea because I thought it was good for my street cred to be on vinyl . . . I love the idea that it will be a collected addition . . . in &#8216;Perry Como red,&#8217; like my parents had when I was young.&#8221;</p>
<div class="flex-video widescreen youtube"><iframe width="1170" height="878" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YnpofBtijF8?feature=oembed&amp;showinfo=0&amp;rel=0&amp;modestbranding=1" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
<p>Waters also worked with the world-famous, Grammy-winning producer Ian Brennan on the record. They first re-recorded a commencement speech Waters gave to the Rhode Island School of Design&#8217;s graduating class of 2015. The rest of the album contains conversations and excerpts with Brennan about Waters&#8217; latest book, <em>Make Trouble</em>. Even though Waters isn&#8217;t a fan of hearing his own voice, in 2014 he received a Grammy nomination for best spoken-word album with the audiobook for <em>Carsick</em>.</p>
<p>Waters starts off <em>Make Trouble</em> by explaining how he was kicked out of his college dormitory due to his first ever scandal involving cannabis. So did that experience scare him away from the wacky-tobaccy? &#8220;I have pot for my guests, but I don&#8217;t smoke much, as it makes me worry,&#8221; he divulges. &#8220;Maybe once in a while with my friend, Frankie. On a Friday night we&#8217;ll smoke a joint, have a martini and just start ranting and laughing.&#8221; He&#8217;s obviously not against cannabis, and points out with a giggle, &#8220;I had a great time when I was young and had a great time with pot. But now that it&#8217;s legal, it&#8217;s boring.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34535" src="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/photocreditGregGorman.jpg" alt="John Waters" width="733" height="1100" srcset="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/photocreditGregGorman.jpg 733w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/photocreditGregGorman-682x1024.jpg 682w" sizes="(max-width: 733px) 100vw, 733px"></p>
<p>One of the themes that stands out in John Waters&#8217; work, and particularly throughout <em>Make Trouble</em>, is his never-ending well of self-confidence, patience and persistence. Throughout his career, Waters has had his share of negativity. So what&#8217;s his secret to dealing with adversity and maintaining his confidence?</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anyone in show business has self-confidence, to be honest,&#8221; he remarks. &#8220;Because why else would they go into a field where strangers have to like us to make a living? My secret is you have to believe for real what it is you&#8217;re saying. Like when I do my show, I am exaggerating and doing it for humor, but basically everything I make fun of I really like.&#8221; And that&#8217;s why his career has lasted so long. Everything that John Waters likes, we Earthlings seem to like, too.</p>

INSERT INTO articles VALUES (12561, 'Study: Cannabis Protects the Liver From Alcohol Damage', NULL, 'cannabis-protects-liver-alcohol-damage-1280x800.jpg', '<div class="uncode_text_column"><p>We hear a lot about the effects of cannabis on the brain and body, but rarely do we consider its effects when used in combination with other drugs, like alcohol. Studying the health impacts of both alcohol and cannabis on their own is valuable, but it doesn&#8217;t always reflect the public&#8217;s use patterns. Therefore, it&#8217;s important to understand the impact that the combination of alcohol and cannabis has on health outcomes. A recent <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/liv.13696/full">study</a> took up this challenge by investigating the effect of cannabis consumption on alcoholic liver disease.<br>
</p>
<div id="leafly-dfp-ad-widget-mobile-medium-rectangle-485805204" class="leafly-dfp-ad-container">    </div>
<h2>What Is Alcoholic Liver Disease?</h2>
<p>Drinking a lot of alcohol over many years causes <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25447847" target="_blank" rel="noopener">liver disease</a> by consistently elevating levels of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016508514013377?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflammation</a>. Alcohol directly damages liver cells and causes an inflammatory response. Additionally, alcohol disturbs the walls of the intestine, leading to a recruitment of inflammatory cells to repair the damage. These inflammatory cells make their way through the intestine to the liver where they contribute to liver inflammation. Alcohol also disrupts the microbes in the gut, causing them to release toxins into the blood stream that the liver tries to break down and becomes inflamed in the process.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/science-tech/the-medical-minute-cannabis-is-exactly-114-times-less-toxic-than"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/11235209/the-medical-minute-cannabis-is-exactly-114-times-less-toxic-than-480x300.png"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Cannabis Is Exactly 114 Times Less Toxic Than Alcohol</div></div></a></div>
<p>These processes lead to the onset and progression of alcoholic liver disease:</p>
<ul>
<li>The progression of alcoholic liver disease often brings a disruption of normal gut function, leading to an excess of fat deposits in the liver. This creates a condition known as &#8220;steatosis,&#8221; or &#8220;fatty liver.&#8221;</li>
<li>The increase in the cellular <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15670660" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stress</a> by the excess of fat cells in the liver leads to a state of constant inflammation of the liver, even in the absence of alcohol. This state is called &#8220;alcoholic hepatitis.&#8221;</li>
<li>Eventually, this inflammation leads to irreversible liver cell damage. The damage reaches a point where few healthy cells remain and the liver becomes scarred with non-functioning tissue. This stage is called &#8220;cirrhosis,&#8221; and liver function is severely compromised.</li>
<li>Lastly, the ongoing inflammation for years, if not decades, also increases risk for liver cancer, called &#8220;hepatocellular carcinoma.&#8221;</li>
</ul>
<p>These four manifestations characterize the devastating alcoholic liver disease, which turns out to be quite common. Nearly <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2300494" target="_blank" rel="noopener">29%</a> of individuals have had an alcohol use disorder in their lifetime, and among them, <a href="http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(11)62487-7/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20%</a> develop liver disease. And it can kill you. In fact, those with an alcohol use disorder are <a href="https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh27-3/209-219.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">23</a> times more likely to die from a liver disease. What if there was a way to reduce the risk of alcoholic liver disease in those with an alcohol use disorder?</p>
<p>Indeed there may be, and cannabis may hold the key.</p>

<h2>Study Findings: The Effects of Cannabis on Alcoholic Liver Disease</h2>
<p>In a massive study that included 320,000 individuals with an alcohol use disorder* (of which over 26,000 were non-dependent cannabis users and 4,300 were dependent cannabis users), the scientists revealed that cannabis use protected against developing alcoholic liver disease.</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">Cannabis had less of a protective effect in those who consumed more alcohol and met the criteria for alcohol dependence.</div>
<p>The scientists found that regardless of whether people were frequent or infrequent cannabis consumers, cannabis protected against developing each of the four stages of liver disease. Notably, the heaviest cannabis consumers had the greatest protection against alcoholic liver disease.</p>
<p>Specifically, cannabis use was associated with (<em>note: percentages are for combined dependent and non-dependent cannabis consumers</em>):</p>
<ul>
<li>45% reduction in alcoholic steatosis (fatty liver)</li>
<li>40% reduction in alcoholic hepatitis (inflamed liver)</li>
<li>55% reduction in alcoholic cirrhosis (scarred liver)</li>
<li>75% reduction in hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer)</li>
</ul>
<p>It must be noted that cannabis was most protective in individuals who met the diagnostic criteria for <em>alcohol abuse</em>. Cannabis had less of a protective effect in those who presumably consumed more alcohol and met the criteria for <em>alcohol dependence</em>. Broadly speaking, alcohol abuse is drinking too much too often, while dependence is the inability to quit. In most cases, those who are dependent end up consuming more alcohol throughout their lives. So it appears that cannabis is only protective against alcoholic liver disease to a point; the more you drink, the less cannabis can help.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/science-tech/study-finds-alcohol-10-times-more-deadly-than-cannabis-on-the-road"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/17151114/drunk-driving-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Study Finds Alcohol 10 Times Deadlier Than Cannabis on the Road</div></div></a></div>
<p><em>* Alcohol use disorder is made up of both alcohol abuse and dependence. You can generally think of alcohol abuse as drinking too much too often, while dependence is the inability to quit. Despite both being classified as an alcohol use disorder, they reflect differences in the way that alcohol affects brain <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/npp2009110" target="_blank" rel="noopener">functioning</a></em><em>, as well as the changes in the brain that result from long-term consumption. </em></p>
<h2>Cannabis Protects Against Liver Cancer by Reducing Inflammation</h2>
<p>Despite the growing excitement of certain cannabinoids in cancer <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2016.00361/full">treatment</a>, the scientists concluded that cannabis&#8217; protection against liver cancer mostly came from its ability to prevent cirrhosis. This is therefore a different protective mechanism than halting or killing the cancer directly. Since <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2731180/">90%</a> of hepatocellular carcinoma stems from cirrhosis, cannabis&#8217; block of this critical step illustrates its substantial therapeutic potential to prevent the onset of these life-threatening conditions.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/health/cannabis-and-cancer"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/29202704/cannabis-and-cancer-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Cannabis and Cancer</div></div></a></div>
<p>But their results still leave open the possibility for cannabis&#8217; direct anti-cancer effects. The scientists report that cannabis use was associated with a similar reduction in liver cancer in both alcohol abusers and those who were dependent. Since cannabis was less effective at preventing cirrhosis in those with alcohol dependence, it leaves open the possibility that cannabis directly blocked the development of liver cancer independent of its effects on cirrhosis. Additional studies are needed to assess the effectiveness of cannabis&#8217; anti-cancer properties in the liver.</p>
<h2>Alcohol Increases Inflammation</h2>
<p>Alcohol damages the brain and body by increasing inflammation, and this inflammation contributes to <a href="http://www.gastrojournal.org/article/S0016-5085(11)01228-5/abstract" target="_blank" rel="noopener">liver disease</a>. The anti-inflammatory <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2828614/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">properties</a> of the primary cannabinoids, THC and <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/science-tech/what-does-cbd-do">cannabidiol</a> (CBD), lead one to predict that cannabis consumption could reduce inflammation caused by alcohol, and therefore help prevent the development of liver disease.</p>
<p>However, cannabis&#8217; anti-inflammatory effects are not so straight forward in the liver. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2219532/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">THC</a> activates cannabinoid type I and type II receptors (CB1 and CB2), while CBD blocks THC&#8217;s actions at CB1 receptors and activates CB2 receptors. This distinction is important considering that activating <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21863215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CB1</a> receptors has <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21254182" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pro-inflammatory</a> effects in the liver and leads to liver disease, while <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24398069" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CB2</a> activation has anti-inflammatory effects and protects against liver disease. These effects have been identified in laboratory models of liver disease, but cannabis&#8217; effect on alcoholic liver disease in humans had not yet been assessed.</p>
<p>Cannabis&#8217; anti-inflammatory properties are already being <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2828614/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">utilized</a> for pain relief as well as treatment for colitis (inflammation of the colon), multiple sclerosis, and arthritis. <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/what-cannabis-strains-are-high-in-cbd">Balanced THC/CBD strains or CBD-dominant strains</a> may provide even greater anti-inflammatory effects, and hopefully better prevent alcoholic liver disease.</p>

<p>Thanks to legislative action, two more states are getting closer to having a medical <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> program. Close votes by lawmakers in Tennessee and Oklahoma indicate that these two states are slowly moving toward medical marijuana. But both states have more work to do before medicinal cannabis programs are put into place.</p>
<h2>First Up: Tennessee</h2>
<p>In Tennessee, legislators are considering the Medical Cannabis Only Act. If passed, the bill would allow patients to use cannabis oil medicines. The law forbids plant forms of cannabis, as well as smoking and vaping.</p>
<p>Rep. Jeremy Faison, R-Cosby, and Sen. Steve Dickerson, R-Nashville, introduced the bill in January of this year. Sen. Dickerson is an anesthesiologist by profession.</p>
<p>The House Criminal Justice subcommittee voted on the measure Tuesday. During the meeting, patient activists, lobbyists, and representatives of law enforcement packed the committee chamber.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Stacie Mathes explained to lawmakers how medical marijuana has helped her sick daughter, <a href="http://www.wate.com/news/tennessee/cannabis-bill-passes-subcommittee-after-speaker-beth-harwell-casts-deciding-vote/996367470" rel="nofollow">according to reports in local media</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am here because I know it works,&#8221; Mathes said. &#8220;If we had <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/science/thc-tetrahydrocannabinol/">THC</a> when we had the four medications she was on, it would not have taken us 11-months and days and days and days of withdrawals.&#8221;</p>
<p>Law enforcement took their predictable prohibitionist stance. Terry Ashe, the Executive Director of the Tennessee Sheriff&#8217;s Association, also addressed the panel. His group is opposed to cannabis because of its status under federal law.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not here to practice medicine,&#8221; said Ashe. &#8220;We are here to ask you all to understand we are not going to support Schedule One drugs in the state.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>The situation became dramatic when it came time for the subcommittee to vote. Six representatives make up the committee. Their 3-3 tie vote on whether to advance the bill would have meant the death of the measure.</p>
<p>But Rep. Beth Harwell, the Speaker of the Tennessee House of Representatives, exercised her power to break the tie. Her &#8220;aye&#8221; vote allows the bill to continue the legislative process.</p>
<h2>On To Oklahoma</h2>
<p>In Oklahoma, voters will decide on the legalization of medicinal cannabis in June of this year. State Question 788 legalizes possession, use, and cultivation of cannabis for medical purposes if passed.</p>
<p>The state legislature is working on measures that would regulate the cannabis industry if Question 788 is successful. Senate Bill 1120 limits the number of licenses for businesses and allows the state to set prices on cannabis products.</p>
<p>The legislation also specifies the medical conditions for which doctors may prescribe medical marijuana. The Senate Health and Human Services Committee approved the bill on Monday by a 6-5 vote, allowing it to move on.</p>
<p>Sen. Ervin Yen, a Republican from Oklahoma City, wrote the bill. He sees himself as a solitary cannabis advocate.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentC -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc article_middleContentC dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m the only guy in the Senate that&#8217;s trying to legalize marijuana. The only one,&#8221; said Yen, <a href="http://newsok.com/oklahoma-lawmakers-taking-shot-at-medical-marijuana-regulations-before-vote/article/5584882" rel="nofollow">according to published reports</a>. &#8220;And I think if Oklahoma&#8217;s going to do it, we need to do it the right way.&#8221;</p>
<p>But activists who succeeded in putting Question 788 on the ballot are not happy with Yen&#8217;s proposals. Chip Paul of Oklahomans for Health said that limiting medical cannabis to a specific list of ailments is a step backward.</p>
<p>&#8220;Medical conditions are arbitrary. They&#8217;re always subject to change. We&#8217;ve written a progressive law that puts the decision in the hands of the physician. Our law ends up being more restrictive than any other in the country,&#8221; said Paul.</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;These Two States Are Slowly Moving Toward Medical Marijuana</h2>
<p>Responding to critics, Sen. Yen said his bill is a starting point, and he&#8217;s open to compromise.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s stuff in it that could be changed because it&#8217;s a work in progress,&#8221; said the bill&#8217;s author, state Sen. Ervin Yen. &#8220;As you can imagine, legalizing marijuana, there&#8217;s a lot of moving parts with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>But he also noted he believes Question 788 goes too far.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s titled &#8216;medical&#8217; but in my opinion, it&#8217;s recreational. I don&#8217;t want that for Oklahoma,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (<em>AP</em>) &#8212; Arkansas took the first step Tuesday toward launching its medical marijuana program, as state regulators named the five businesses they intend to license to grow the drug.</p>
<p>The state Medical Marijuana Commission announced the top applications for cultivation facilities, which will grow and provide cannabis for dispensaries to sell under a 2016 voter-approved measure. The panel is expected later this year to license up to 32 dispensaries to sell the drug.</p>
<p>The companies have seven days to pay a $100,000 licensing fee and post a $500,000 performance bond in order to receive the licenses.</p>
<p>The companies are Natural State Medicinals Cultivation in Jefferson County, Bold Team LLC in Woodruff County, Natural State Wellness Enterprises in Jefferson or Jackson County, Osage Creek Cultivation in Carroll County and Delta Medical Cannabis Company Inc. in Jackson County.</p>
<p>Natural State Wellness Enterprises&#8217; investors include former Attorney General Dustin McDaniel, who said the company hopes to decide in the next 24 to 36 hours in which county to locate. The company had two applications among the top five, but is prohibited from opening more than one facility.</p>
<p>&#8220;We appreciate that it is a public trust that has been placed upon our company to produce quality, safe, and legal medicine to Arkansas patients,&#8221; said McDaniel, who is also an attorney and lobbyist for the company. &#8220;We will make a location decision shortly and will promptly begin construction.&#8221;</p>
<p>Delta Medical Cannabis has a property under contract in Newport, about 89 miles northeast of Little Rock, and will likely have its facility up and running by the end of this year or early 2019.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re building a state of the art facility from the ground up,&#8221; said Donald Parker, an owner and attorney of the company.</p>
<p>The state received 95 applications for cultivation facilities. The applications were scored by each of the five commissioners on several factors, including business experience, qualifications and finances. The commission will meet March 14 to formally award licenses to companies that complied with the requirements.</p>
<p>The state has approved more than 4,100 applications for patients to use medical marijuana, and will issue registry cards about a month before the drug is expected to be available legally.</p>
<p>The licenses were announced the same day dozens of medical marijuana supporters appeared at the state Capitol to urge lawmakers to make changes to the medical marijuana program next year. The proposals include adding qualifying medical conditions, ending a 4 percent tax on medical marijuana sales and allowing students approved to use medical marijuana to have access to non-smokeable forms of cannabis on school grounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;We wanted everyone to really understand what the real story is. It&#8217;s not about five businessmen that are going to make a lot of money,&#8221; Corey Hunt with the Arkansas Cannabis Industry Association, said. &#8220;It&#8217;s about these patients here who fought years and years and years.&#8221;</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Florida Congressman, an early and ardent supporter of medical marijuana in the Sunshine State, was asked by Lisa &#8220;Kennedy&#8221; about his ongoing effort to reclassify marijuana at the federal level &#8211; and expanding medical marijuana research. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After noting that he was excited to &#8220;come on and talk about guns and weed,&#8221; Gaetz told Kennedy his proposed legislation would dramatically increase research and would prohibit the federal government from blocking future cannabis studies.</span></p>

<p>According to reports, Kodak Black pleads not guilty to <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a> possession. The rapper, whose real name is&#160;Dieuson Octave, also plead not guilty on Tuesday to the additional remaining charge, related to possession of a firearm, stemming from a January arrest.</p>
<h2>The Charges</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.local10.com/news/florida/broward/south-florida-rapper-kodak-black-pleads-not-guilty-to-pot-ammo-charges" rel="nofollow">local news</a>, the South Florida rapper&#160;pleaded not guilty to <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/should-marijuana-possession-cause-loss-of-driving-privileges/">possession of marijuana</a> and possession of ammunition on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Octave&#8217;s plead comes just a week after the State of Florida dropped several charges against the rapper, including&#160;possession of a weapon or ammunition by a delinquent, grand theft of a firearm and child neglect.</p>
<p>All of the charges stem from the aforementioned January arrest after police raided the rapper&#8217;s home. He<span class="s1"> was caught flaunting firearms and weed in a live video on his Instagram</span>.</p>
<p>The video showed several people flaunting guns and drugs in front of an infant. Octave has been on probation since August 2016 and isn&#8217;t allowed to have guns or, obviously, drugs in his possession.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>According to police reports, officers found 95 grams of pot in the rapper&#8217;s home and was later charged with&#160;grand theft of a firearm, two counts of possession of a weapon or ammunition by a felon, suspicion of committing child neglect and two counts of violating of probation.</p>
<p>At the time of the arrest, it was unclear whether or not the rapper was simply trolling his fans when police were clearly audible in the background. However, in the video, you can hear Octave talking with the Broward Sherriff&#8217;s Office, before getting arrested.</p>
<p>The rapper&#160;has remained behind bars since his January 18th arrest. He is scheduled to appear in court again on May 3rd.</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;Kodak Black Pleads Not Guilty To Marijuana Possession</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, this is far from the first offense for the 20-year-old South Florida rapper.</p>
<p>Back in May 2016, Octave was arrested for&#160;possession of a firearm by a delinquent, armed robbery, false imprisonment and attempting to elude law enforcement.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">

		</div>

<p>Things got worse for black this past October, where he was charged with&#160;first-degree criminal sexual conduct after allegedly assaulting a teenage fan after a concert.</p>
<p>The rapper was eventually released December 1 on a $100,000 bond but could up to 30 years in prison if convicted.</p>
<p>So while Black&#8217;s gun and weed charges may stem from the January incident, the entire ordeal was exacerbated because of the rapper&#8217;s prior run-ins with the law.</p>
<p>And if it had only been weed, chances are, Black could have avoided the incident entirely, considering it&#8217;s been <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/politics/tampa-decriminalizes-marijuana-possession/">decriminalized in certain parts of Florida</a>.</p>
<p>Then again, his probation and prior convictions likely would not have deterred&#160;cops from taking it easy on the young rapper.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>The 2018 FIFA World Cup is set to take place in Russia this year, so naturally, there will be some in-house rules that will vastly differentiate from what we are accustomed to seeing. One such stipulation would be the allowance of otherwise illicit&#160;substances into the stadium, including medical <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a>, provided fans supply proof they are to be used for proper medicinal reasons. That&#8217;s right: Soccer fans may bring medical marijuana to Russia for FIFA World Cup.</p>
<h2>Substances Allowed At The World Cup</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://themoscowtimes.com/news/world-cup-fans-allowed-bring-medical-marijuana-russia-60648" rel="nofollow">The Moscow Times</a>, The Eurasian Economic Union will allow soccer fans to bring banned substances into the stadium, so long as they have the medical documents to prove its medicinal value.</p>
<p>According to the regulations, fans will be allowed to bring a plethora of otherwise illicit&#160;substances, including <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/medical-marijuana-given-seniors/">medical marijuana</a>, <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/countries-use-cocaine/">cocaine</a>, and even <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/report-most-heroin-is-tainted-by-fentanyl/">heroin</a>.</p>
<p>While the decision certainly seems like one of questionable ethics,&#160;Russia&#8217;s 2018 World Cup Organizing Committee claims the drugs will be heavily regulated, and that there will be law enforcement officers throughout the stadium verifying each and every medical document for proper authenticity.</p>
<p>&#8220;Security officers will monitor the enforcement of rules for carrying prescription drugs to stadium grounds at checkpoints,&#8221; the organizing committee said.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Additionally, Russia&#8217;s&#160;Federal Customs Service has said they would require fans with any drugs to fill out a customs&#160;declaration before entering the stadium.</p>
<p>The country is set to host the World Cup from June 14 to July 15 in 11 major Russian cities, including Moscow, Saransk.St. Petersburg and Sochi.</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;Soccer Fans May Bring Medical Marijuana to Russia For FIFA World Cup</h2>
<p>This is certainly a strange development for the 2018 World Cup.</p>
<p>The country, which was awarded rights to the game back in 2010, has seen it&#8217;s fair share of controversies over the past several years, so this remains a minuscule&#160;issue. But a bizarre&#160;one, nevertheless.</p>
<p>While one can see the allowance of medical marijuana to the games, it&#8217;s difficult to envision any organization allowing hard drugs like cocaine and heroin into the stadium.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Then again, for a country that once<a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-14232970" rel="nofollow"> considered beer a soft drink</a>, perhaps this notion isn&#8217;t so ludicrous, relative to the environment.</p>
<p>And if you want to factor in the notion that Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the United States federal government&#160;considers<a href="https://hightimes.com/news/california-formally-asks-feds-to-reschedule-weed/"> marijuana on par with heroin</a>, and a whole Schedule worse than cocaine, it&#8217;s not all that surprising that the three substances were lumped together.</p>
<p>This should make for a very interesting World Cup.</p>

					<p>The city of Denver granted its first license on Monday to a business that will allow marijuana use on its premises. The Coffee Joint plans to charge patrons a $5 entry fee and permit them to consume their own cannabis in edible or vapor form.<span id="more-69807"></span></p>
<p>Denver voters approved a measure to create a social-use pilot program in 2016. Interested businesses like cafes and art galleries must jump through several bureaucratic hurdles to apply &#8211; including obtaining the support of a neighborhood group. The Coffee Joint was the first business to submit an application and received no opposition to its plan to allow cannabis consumption on its premises. Businesses that serve alcohol are barred from applying.</p>
<p>While several states have now legalized adult-use marijuana, no state has implemented a social-use program yet. The lack of cannabis-friendly space presents challenges for tourists and residents alike, who are legally only allowed to consume cannabis in private residences. Denver&#8217;s pilot program was the first regulated program of its kind &#8211; although states including Alaska, Nevada, and Massachusetts have been discussing implementing a similar program.</p>

<p>A bill advancing through the Colorado legislature would open the doors for out-of-state individuals and publicly traded companies to invest or have ownership interest in state-licensed cannabis businesses.</p>
<p><a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb18-1011">House Bill 1011</a>, &#8220;Marijuana Businesses Allow Publicly Traded Owners,&#8221; on Wednesday passed the House Finance Committee on a vote of 8 to 5.</p>
<p>Bill co-sponsors and proponents earlier in the week touted the proposed law change as a necessary means for Colorado&#8217;s cannabis businesses to remain competitive. Colorado may have been a trailblazer in regulating adult-use cannabis sales, but its homegrown businesses are being left in the dust as the industry goes global.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re at a point where we&#8217;re actually behind the curve,&#8221; said Rep. Dan Pabon, D-Denver, Wednesday, when addressing the Finance Committee.</p>
<p>More than a dozen medical and recreational cannabis states have allowed for out-of-state investors or publicly traded companies and, as such, are seeing more investment capital flow to their industries, said Pabon, who co-sponsored the bill with Rep. Kevin Van Winkle, R-Highlands Ranch, Sen. Tim Neville, R-Littleton, and Sen. Cheri Jahn, U-Wheat Ridge.</p>
<p>The bill expands on a 2016 law <a href="http://extras.denverpost.com/app/bill-tracker/bills/2016a/sb_16-040/">that allowed limited out-of-state investment</a> in Colorado&#8217;s cannabis industry.</p>
<p>The new bill repeals provisions that limit out-of-state ownership to 15 individuals as well as the provisions that prohibited publicly traded entities from holding a marijuana license. This would allow for both increased investment from existing public companies as well as opening the doors for local licensed businesses to become publicly traded, Pabon said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/tag/andy-williams/">Andy Williams</a>, a Colorado cannabis entrepreneur, spoke in favor of the bill during the public comments phase on Monday evening.</p>
<p>&#8220;I do see where the money&#8217;s flowing right now, and it&#8217;s not to Colorado,&#8221; said Williams, co-founder of several Colorado cannabis firms including Medicine Man Denver and publicly traded consulting firm Medicine Man Technologies.</p>

<hr>
<p>Also speaking in favor of the bill was Kristi Kelly, of the <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/tag/marijuana-industry-group/">Marijuana Industry Group</a>.</p>
<p>Not all Colorado cannabis businesses are necessarily on board with the move. Meg Collins, vice president of public affairs for Good Chemistry, a cultivator and retailer of cannabis, said Good Chemistry has taken a &#8220;neutral&#8221; stance. On Monday, she urged caution.</p>
<p>Collins said the topic &#8220;is an important conversation&#8221; to have about the marijuana industry&#8217;s future, but should be considered in light of the ongoing uncertainty of state-based marijuana programs while marijuana remains illegal federally.</p>
<p>&#8220;This sweeping, material change in our regulations could significantly increase the risk of federal scrutiny,&#8221; Collins said. &#8220;Our industry does not reside in a bubble.&#8221;</p>
<p>The legislation also could potentially increase the risk of &#8220;bad actors&#8221; entering the market, she added.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the bill was amended to require increased reporting requirements for publicly traded companies to the Colorado Marijuana Enforcement Division.</p>
<p>As deliberations continued Wednesday, committee member Rep. Adrienne Benavidez, D-Commerce City, expressed concern that penny-stock companies would enter the market. Companies that <a href="https://www.otcmarkets.com/corporate-services/get-started">trade over-the-counter</a> on the OTCQB exchange do not have as robust reporting requirements as those that trade on the OTCQX, she said.</p>
<p>Benavidez, who ultimately voted against the bill, said she would support it with added restrictions for OTCQB companies.</p>
<p>The bill now heads to the House Appropriations committee.</p>

Warren County Prosecutor David Fornshell says Adams, a milk delivery man, snuck marijuana, tobacco and cellphones into an Ohio prison hidden in milk cartons. Fornshell says the suspect had an inmate contact inside who facilitated the delivery and set up payment for the milkman. Fornshell says Adams made thousands of dollars delivering the items over time. (Warren County Sheriff&#8217;s Office via AP)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ray Adams was in contact with an inmate at Lebanon Correctional Facility who facilitated the deliveries and set up payments, according to Warren County Prosecutor David Fornshell.</p>
<p>Adams, an employee of Martins Ferry-based United Dairy Inc., made thousands of dollars sneaking the items in over time, Fornshell said</p>
<p>On Jan. 8, authorities searched the nearly 30,000 milk cartons Adams was delivering that day and found contraband, including 12 cellphones, in 30 of them.</p>
<p>Adams, 50, has not yet entered a plea to charges of conveying drugs and cellphones and remains free on bond. His attorney and United Dairy did not immediately return messages seeking comment.</p>
<p>Prisons spokeswoman JoEllen Smith declined to comment because of the pending criminal charges against Adams.</p>
<p>Ohio began relying on outside companies to deliver milk to prisons after selling off its dairy cows in 2016. Reducing contraband was one of several factors the prisons director cited at the time in support of the move.</p>
<p>&#8220;The department anticipates that phasing out prison farming operations will also minimize the opportunities for passing illegal contraband into our prisons,&#8221; according to an April 2016 fact sheet from the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction.</p>
<p>Adams has been a driver with United Dairy for 14 years and a prison milk deliveryman for the past two years, Fornshell said.</p>
<p>Investigators believe the contraband scheme was dreamed up last August.</p>
<p>Before making deliveries, Adams would meet a contact at a nearby highway gas station and receive substitute milk cartons containing the contraband before entering the prison, Fornshell said. An inmate took it from there.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somebody on the inside had to be looking for the milk cartons coming in, knowing how they were going to be marked, knowing what day they were coming in,&#8221; the prosecutor said.</p>
<p>Fornshell said the investigation was ongoing and there could be additional charges.</p>

					<p>A Massachusetts-based medical marijuana dispensary that specializes in flavorful edibles will now serve up weed-infused pizzas.<span id="more-69861"></span></p>
<p>Ermont Inc., a medical marijuana dispensary located in Quincy, Mass., sells cannabis-infused personal pizzas in the style of the small, thin crust pies that are popular throughout the local bar scene.</p>
<p>At $38, the 6-inch cheese pizza carries 125 milligrams of THC in its tomato sauce, a medium-size dosage of marijuana, according to the dispensary&#8217;s operations manager Seth Yaffe. He describes the pie, baked to serve one person, as &#8220;herby, with gooey, crispy cheese&#8221; that spreads to the edge of the crust.</p>
<p>Yaffe says several of the dispensary&#8217;s patients began requesting more savory edible options to avoid the sugar that fills typical marijuana edibles like candy bars and fruit chews.</p>

<p>Even though the consumption of <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> has fallen in the UK in recent years, weed is still the most popular illegal drug there. But it&#8217;s not the number of people using cannabis that&#8217;s triggering a new round of anti-cannabis concern-trolling in the UK. Instead, some are sounding the alarm over a new study that claims marijuana has become so strong it puts users at risk of developing psychotic disorders. Is the United Kingdom being flooded with high potency cannabis? And does it really pose the mental health dangers some experts say it does?</p>
<h2>Is The United Kingdom Being Flooded With High Potency Cannabis?</h2>
<p>A study published Wednesday in the journal <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dta.2368/abstract" rel="nofollow"><em>Drug Testing and Analysis</em></a> is once again raising concerns about cannabis use and mental health in the UK, where the drug is prohibited. In it, researchers aimed to update the findings of a 2008 study that examined the potency of &#8220;street cannabis.&#8221;</p>
<p>The current study analyzed 460 samples of cannabis from the same areas of the UK assessed in the 2008 report. The gas chromatography results indicate that illicit cannabis in the UK hasn&#8217;t gotten any stronger; there&#8217;s just more of it on the market.</p>
<p>In 2005, one study found that <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/science/thc-tetrahydrocannabinol/">THC concentrations</a> fell around a 13.9 percent median. According to the new study, the concentration of <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/science/thc-tetrahydrocannabinol/">THC</a> was just marginally higher, at 14.2 percent. So from the looks of it, nothing has changed in terms of the <a href="https://hightimes.com/culture/in-house-potency-testing-for-pot-businesses/">potency of cannabis in the UK</a>. And 14.2 percent isn&#8217;t that high, considering many strains in the US are capable of topping 20 percent THC.</p>
<p>Yet the results of the 2018 study found something else that&#8217;s interesting. While THC levels have remained essentially the same, levels of <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/cannabidiol-cbd/">cannabidiol (CBD)</a> dropped significantly over the last decade.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>CBD, a major phytocannabinoid with no psychoactivity, is the compound researchers believe imparts many of the medicinal and therapeutic benefits of cannabis use. Furthermore, CBD acts as an antagonist to THC. From a recreational perspective, this means CBD can help counteract some of the stronger effects of THC. <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/cbd/best-cbd-products/">Strains with a balanced or significant content of CBD</a> can, therefore, provide users with a more mellow high.</p>
<p>Yet the samples analyzed in the 2018 study showed significantly decreased CBD contents and lower CBD:THC ratios. And this means that despite similar THC levels, the strains in the UK today could create stronger psychoactive effects. Effectively, then, they are more potent.</p>
<h2>Is High Potency Cannabis Really A Mental Health Concern?</h2>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-182000 aligncenter" src="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/is-the-united-kingdom-being-flooded-with-high-potency-cannabis-2.jpg" alt="Is The United Kingdom Being Flooded With High Potency Cannabis?" width="1000" height="600" srcset="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/is-the-united-kingdom-being-flooded-with-high-potency-cannabis-2.jpg 1000w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/is-the-united-kingdom-being-flooded-with-high-potency-cannabis-2-100x60.jpg 100w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/is-the-united-kingdom-being-flooded-with-high-potency-cannabis-2-400x240.jpg 400w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/is-the-united-kingdom-being-flooded-with-high-potency-cannabis-2-768x461.jpg 768w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/is-the-united-kingdom-being-flooded-with-high-potency-cannabis-2-590x354.jpg 590w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"></p>
<p>For American recreational cannabis users familiar with dabbing and smoking flowers with 25 percent THC concentrations, 14.2 percent THC may not seem very potent. But in the UK, this represents some of the strongest cannabis available. Colloquially, people in the UK call this kind of weed &#8220;skunk.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the UK, however, &#8220;<a href="https://hightimes.com/news/world/britains-skunk-phenomenon/">skunk</a>&#8221; has a totally different connotation than it does in the US. Instead of indicating a certain strain with a pungent aroma, &#8220;skunk&#8221; weed in the UK refers to any kind of intentionally cultivated plants. If it&#8217;s seedless (i.e. female) and flower, it&#8217;s &#8220;skunk.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Interestingly, hyperbolic concerns over &#8220;skunk&#8221; weed have a decades-old history in the UK. Many tabloid presses will run stories about spurious studies that warn of widespread psychosis among cannabis users. Calling cannabis with 14.2 percent THC &#8220;super-weed&#8221; is, to put it mildly, a bit of an overstatement. Classic reefer madness.</p>
<p>However, the advent of home cultivation trends and the popularity of more potent strains has led to an influx of stronger weed on the market.</p>
<p>The study in <em>Drug Testing and Analysis</em>, though, doesn&#8217;t overreach what its evidence shows. The researchers clearly state that &#8220;high-potency varieties of cannabis [&#8230;] may have concerning implications for public health.&#8221;</p>
<p><em>May have</em>. That&#8217;s hardly &#8220;high-risk super-strength skunk,&#8221; as the headline in <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/most-cannabis-in-the-uk-is-high-risk-super-strength-skunk-study-finds-11270445" rel="nofollow">SkyNews</a> puts it. Neither is it &#8220;seriously bad news&#8221; that &#8220;most of Britain&#8217;s weed is now super-strong skunk,&#8221; like <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2018/02/28/seriously-bad-news-britains-weed-now-super-strong-skunk-expert-7348480/" rel="nofollow">Metro</a> says.</p>
<h2>The Final Hit: Is The United Kingdom Being Flooded With High Potency Cannabis?</h2>
<p>So let&#8217;s sum up: is the United Kingdom being flooded with high potency cannabis? Yes, the lower CBD concentrations in cannabis available in the UK does, from a psychopharmacological perspective, make it more potent. But THC levels have remained steady for at least a decade.</p>
<p>And yes, official statistics do show that more Brits are consuming this kind of cannabis. But what some concern-trolling &#8220;experts&#8221; are hyping as ultra-dangerous super-duper-skunk most might see as just&#160;better weed.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentC -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc article_middleContentC dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Cannabis users in the UK are tired of smoking shitty weed, and the numbers prove it.</p>
<p>As for the concerns over mental health: ending prohibition and establishing a regulated commercial market would have the benefit of allowing researchers to comprehensively study the effects of cannabis use. Indeed, some studies show that high doses of THC can trigger psychotic disorders in people already at risk for developing them. Let&#8217;s find out more about that, instead of spreading exaggerated and unfounded claims about the dangers of cannabis.</p>

											    	<p>We&#8217;ve been talking about <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/bds-analytics/" data-wpel-link="internal">cannabis data</a> quite a bit lately, and for good reason. We&#8217;re finally at a place in the cannabis world where we have reliable scientific data to share with consumers, giving credence to an unfairly stereotyped industry. Data is our path to credibility, and compliance is one of the best <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/medicinal-recreational/" data-wpel-link="internal">measurements</a> to test industry practices.</p>
<p><a href="https://adherence-corp.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Adherence Compliance</a> is one of the many companies working to make cannabis regulations easy to understand and implement so our business owners can focus on their craft&#8212;rather than a bunch of red tape. They recently released data from 2017, &#8220;compiled from physical premise compliance inspections using the Adherence SCORE App.&#8221;</p>
<p>Although their report details compliance statistics for multiple categories, we&#8217;re going to focus solely on the top five compliance issues found among medical cannabis retailers, where regulation is of the utmost importance. Adherence Compliance reports that &#8220;inventory is the top failure item for all marijuana license types&#8221; and that &#8220;75% of all marijuana <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/tier-1-2-and-3-licenses/" data-wpel-link="internal">licenses</a> fail at least one inventory requirement.&#8221;</p>
<h4>Here are the &#8220;Top 5 Medical Dispensary Infractions,&#8221; according to Adherence Compliance:</h4>
<ol>
<li>Inventory not up to date.</li>
<li>Operations logs not up to date (&#8220;visitors, security, and/or waste&#8221; logs).</li>
<li>Lack of proper local and federal documentation.</li>
<li>Products missing &#8220;all required public health and safety warning statements.&#8221;</li>
<li>Surveillance issues; cameras don&#8217;t show entire premises, have &#8220;blind spots or sight obstructions.&#8221;</li>
</ol>
<p>Interestingly, Adherence Compliance found that states with a longer history of legal medical cannabis (California, Washington, Colorado) did <em>worse</em> on compliance testing than their newly-legalized counterparts (Maryland, Illinois, <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/nevada-cancels-seed-to-sale/" data-wpel-link="internal">Nevada</a>). The highest-scoring state for medical dispensaries was Illinois, with a 95.6 compliance rating; California came in last, with a 76.8 rating.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34713" src="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AverageScoresbyState.png" alt="States with a Longer History of Legalization Fare Worse in Compliance Tests" width="2170" height="1480" srcset="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AverageScoresbyState.png 2170w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AverageScoresbyState-768x524.png 768w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AverageScoresbyState-770x525.png 770w" sizes="(max-width: 2170px) 100vw, 2170px"></p>
<p>We reached out to medical dispensaries from around the country to hear their opinion on Adherence Compliance&#8217;s findings.</p>
<p>Kevin Heiderich of Washington state&#8217;s Carlton Cannabis, <a href="http://tacomahouseofcannabis.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Tacoma House of Cannabis</a> and Tonasket House of Cannabis didn&#8217;t seem surprised by the findings: &#8220;With so many areas to run afoul of compliance,&#8221; he explains, &#8220;only the most steadfast and detail-oriented persons will be able to maintain that compliance, and as volume of the store scales, so will the opportunities to fall out of compliance.&#8221;</p>
<p>Heiderich&#8217;s advice for retailers? &#8220;Maintain superior communication with your <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/local-politics/" data-wpel-link="internal">governing authority</a>, and let them take the lead on direction of how to stay in compliance.&#8221;</p>
<p>We also wanted to know how one of the higher-scoring states felt about the findings. I spoke with Jeremy Unruh, Director of Public and Regulatory Affairs at <a href="http://www.pharmacann.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">PharmaCann</a>, based in Illinois and New York (with plans to expand to Maryland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts and Michigan). He says it&#8217;s quite clear why newer markets are excelling at compliance, as compared to &#8220;legacy&#8221; states: limited licenses in the Midwest and East Coast, as opposed to a &#8220;free-for-all&#8221; market in the West.</p>
<p><a href="https://adherence-corp.com" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-34714 size-full" src="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-06-at-4.03.42-PM.png" alt="Cannabis Compliance" width="1438" height="442" srcset="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-06-at-4.03.42-PM.png 1438w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-06-at-4.03.42-PM-768x236.png 768w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-06-at-4.03.42-PM-770x237.png 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1438px) 100vw, 1438px"></a></p>
<p>&#8220;In the western states,&#8221; he told me, &#8220;the number of licenses is basically limited only by the ability to find suitable <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/california-real-estate/" data-wpel-link="internal">real estate</a> and the appetite of local governments to host cannabis operators . . . in contrast, the eastern, newer markets were basically created from scratch . . . The number of licenses are limited by law, and each is given out on a competitive basis.&#160;Only the best, most sophisticated and economically-sound operators win licenses in the east.&#160;Because each of these license-winners has so much at stake, there is a natural focus on ensuring compliance obligations are met.&#160;This tends to keep enforcement activity down.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unruh also points out that the sheer number of dispensaries in the West versus the East plays a large factor in compliance. With more sites to cover in the West, there&#8217;s more room for things falling through the cracks: &#8220;In Illinois, for example, there are only about 20 cultivation/processors.&#160;Those sites are visited by inspectors weekly.&#160;<a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/consistent-quality-cannabis/" data-wpel-link="internal">Regulators</a> have a much tighter grip on the operators in states where they can spend more time at each facility.&#160;In the West, where there are hundreds, if not thousands of licensees, regulators have far less contact with the individual operators.&#160;When the cat&#8217;s away, the mice tend to play.&#8221;</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-34718" src="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AC_logo_horiz1.jpg" alt="Adherence Compliance" width="5208" height="1779" srcset="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AC_logo_horiz1.jpg 5208w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AC_logo_horiz1-768x262.jpg 768w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AC_logo_horiz1-770x263.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 5208px) 100vw, 5208px"></p>
<p>As the industry gallops ahead at its breakneck pace, will we see the trend of newer markets dominating compliance continue? For now, understanding the issues our regional markets face regarding compliance is key to remaining informed consumers. Residents in Washington state may seem dismayed that their state scored so low, and those in Illinois may be ecstatic, but understanding the nature of the industry&#8212;how many licenses were awarded in this region? What exactly are dispensaries being tested on?&#8212;may explain why it&#8217;s so difficult to get a perfect compliance score.</p>

<p>Ask the owners of Confidence Analytics, a cannabis testing lab in Redmond, Washington, that&#8217;s now embroiled in a lawsuit with Walla Walla&#8211;based Banner Bank, and they&#8217;ll tell you that&#8217;s exactly what happened.</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">Sessions&#8217; aim has been &#8220;scaring off investors and financial institutions, and he sees that as a way to slow down the growth of the industry.&#8221;<div class="leafly-pull-quote-attribution">Russ Rosendal, Salal Credit Union</div></div>
<p>In early 2016, the lab&#8217;s owners were shopping around for banking services, looking to upgrade from the local credit union account they&#8217;d been using. &#8220;We went to a couple banks looking to see who would open an account for us, and Banner Bank was very willing,&#8221; Confidence co-owner Nick Mosely told Leafly.</p>
<p>Soon after setting up their commercial account, Mosely said, their banker at Banner&#8217;s Redmond branch, Tony Young, approached them about business loans. &#8220;Tony was very eager to start talking to us about loans,&#8221; Mosely said. &#8220;And it was timely, because we had just heard about these new testing requirements coming up.&#8221;</p>
<p>As part of what was then a new law merging the state&#8217;s medical and adult-use cannabis systems, testing labs would soon need to begin screening for pesticides and heavy metals in addition to the regular potency and microbial tests they&#8217;d had been performing. That meant a need for expensive new equipment. Young&#8217;s loan pitch couldn&#8217;t have come at a better time.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/industry/leafly-investigation-washingtons-top-cannabis-lab-inflating-thc-numbers"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/28112322/thc-testing-1-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Leafly Investigation: Is Washington&#8217;s Top Cannabis Lab Inflating THC Numbers?</div></div></a></div>
<p>Confidence began the loan application process, and in May 2016&#8212;just as Trump was for the first time <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/23/donald-trump-poll-hillary-clinton-presidential-election-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overtaking Hillary Clinton</a> in some presidential polls&#8212;the bank funded a loan for $135,000. The lab purchased two pieces of testing equipment, began paying back the loan, and went on with business as usual.</p>
<p>Later that year, in November, Mosely checked in with Eric Scroggins, Banner&#8217;s branch manager whom Mosely said they&#8217;d been passed off to after Young retired, to see about getting another loan to fund a friendly takeover of a struggling Oregon lab.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were going to need to tool them up in order to be compliant with Oregon&#8217;s new rules&#8212;they needed pesticide and heavy metals, all the stuff that we already knew how to do&#8212;so we went back to Eric saying, &#8216;We&#8217;re looking for a loan.&#8217; He said, &#8216;Sounds good, let&#8217;s start the application process and get this rolling.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<p>Then, shortly after the presidential election, Confidence got a call from Scroggins, this time with a very different tone.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/industry/cannabis-credit-union-gets-go-ahead-from-federal-reserve"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/06094535/fourth-corner-cannabis-credit-union-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Cannabis Credit Union Gets Go-Ahead From Federal Reserve</div></div></a></div>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t have the exact dates,&#8221; Mosely said, &#8220;but it was late November&#8212;after the election, after Thanksgiving&#8212;that I received a call from Eric informing me that the underwriters or higher-ups above him had decided that we were not a business that they could do business with and that they were going to consider us in default of our loan for having violated federal marijuana laws.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mosely and his business partner, Bobby Hines, were shocked, they said. They had assumed that Banner was fully aware of their cannabis-related activities. After all, they weren&#8217;t exactly shy about it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our logo has little pot leaves in it!&#8221; said Mosely. &#8220;Every signature on every email!&#8221;</p>
<p>Confidence had also discussed its business extensively and explicitly with Young, the owners said, and even hosted him for a site visit. Though Scroggins never visited the lab, they say he had requested a copy of financial documents detailing their relationships with clients.</p>
<p>&#8220;That included a list of all of our customers at the time, which was 400-some-odd marijuana farms, some of which have business names that are literally &#8216;Marijuana Farm,&#8217;&#8221; Hines said. &#8220;It&#8217;s pretty obvious.&#8221;</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/industry/a-top-cannabis-lawyer-on-what-losing-the-cole-memo-means"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/05154448/legal-reaction-cole-memo-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">A Top Cannabis Lawyer on What Losing the Cole Memo Means</div></div></a></div>
<p>Regardless, in January 2017, the testing lab received an <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/372572028/Banner-Bank-letter-to-Confidence-Analytics-Termination-of-Banking-Relationship" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official notice of default</a>. &#8220;Banner Bank does not do business with customers whose business is the cannabis industry,&#8221; It said. &#8220;Banner Bank, under controlling federal law, is not allowed to do business with such persons; and, as a matter of its own internal business policy, Banner Bank has determined that it will not do business with such persons.&#8221;</p>
<p>As a result of that notice, say Mosely and Hines, Confidence nearly went out of business.</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">&#8220;As Banner Bank is a federally regulated institution, we chose not to pursue banking relationships within the cannabis industry.&#8221;<div class="leafly-pull-quote-attribution">Dianne Larsen, Banner Bank</div></div>
<p>&#8220;We laid off six valuable employees,&#8221; Hines said. &#8220;We lost a lot of money. Honestly, it hit us at a really bad time, because we had another instrument go down and we really needed capital to replace it, but we had just spent all of our capital on paying off this loan.&#8221;</p>
<p>Confidence is now suing Banner for damages, alleging &#8220;unfair and deceptive business practices.&#8221; In its complaint, first filed in March 2017, Confidence says that Tony Young gave them repeated assurances that Banner was comfortable working with the cannabis industry, which was allowed under a <a href="https://www.fincen.gov/resources/statutes-regulations/guidance/bsa-expectations-regarding-marijuana-related-businesses" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2014 Treasury Department guidance memo</a>, a document that remains in place today.</p>
<p>&#8220;They absolutely, 100% knew,&#8221; said Patrick Moberg, a lawyer for Confidence. Even if Scroggins and Young kept the nature of Confidence&#8217;s business activities hidden from their superiors, which he suspects they did, Moberg said a bank teller at Banner had independently identified Confidence as a cannabis account after receiving a deposit bag with a strong cannabis odor. (The lab uses deposit bags interchangeably for transporting samples and actual deposits, Moberg said.)</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/industry/would-a-public-cannabis-bank-really-work-in-california"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/22154049/public-banks-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Would a &#8216;Public Cannabis Bank&#8217; Really Work in California?</div></div></a></div>
<p>Scroggins&#8217; call, Moberg, Hines, and Mosely now suspect, had less to do with the bank suddenly finding out that they&#8217;d accidentally lent money to a cannabis lab and more to do with recent political events. Trump&#8217;s nomination of Sessions was announced just before Thanksgiving, Mosely remembers, and the call came right after.</p>
<p>A representative for Banner Bank, Senior Vice President Dianne Larsen, said in an email to Leafly that the bank does not comment on &#8220;matters pertaining to client relationships or ongoing legal matters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The federal government identifies cannabis as an illegal drug,&#8221; Larsen continued. &#8220;As Banner Bank is a federally regulated institution, we chose not to pursue banking relationships within the cannabis industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>In its response to the lawsuit, filed in King County Superior Court, Banner argues that they were never aware of the nature of Confidence&#8217;s business and would never have given them a loan if they were. In a countersuit, they alleged that Confidence purposefully failed to disclose that they were a cannabis business in order to secure the loan&#8212;a claim Mosely and Hines deny.</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">&#8220;Our logo has little pot leaves in it!&#8221;<div class="leafly-pull-quote-attribution">Nick Mosely, Confidence Analytics</div></div>
<p>Asked whether Sessions&#8217; appointment may have played a role in the bank&#8217;s decision, Russ Rosendal, the CEO of Salal Credit Union, one of Washington&#8217;s most active lenders to the cannabis industry, acknowledged that the appointment of Sessions certainly sent a chill through some financial institutions.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve heard of a number of people who had talked about trying to get into the business, both from the deposit and lending side, and they were testing and seeing how they could do it,&#8221; Rosendal said, &#8220;They just completely pulled out. If you were just dabbling in it, [Sessions&#8217; appointment] would have scared you quite a bit.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think that&#8217;s what happened,&#8221; agreed Moberg, the attorney for Confidence. &#8220;They saw other banks doing it, and they were like, &#8216;Why are we missing out on this money?&#8217; And then they got scared when Trump got elected.&#8221;</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/jeff-sessions-giving-you-trouble-washington-state-ag-wants-to-know"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/23122248/washington-attorney-general-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Jeff Sessions Giving You Trouble? Washington State AG Wants to Know</div></div></a></div>
<p>Even in light of Sessions&#8217; move last month to rescind the Cole memo, a DOJ guidance memo that encouraged prosecutors to not interfere in state-legal cannabis programs, Confidence&#8217;s case appears to be unusual. Nevertheless, it&#8217;s an indication of what many in the industry say is a tougher post-election climate for cannabis businesses seeking basic banking services or access to capital.</p>
<p>Even at Salal, which continues to work with the cannabis industry, Rosendal said the credit union has been much more careful about screening new accounts. The price tag for cannabis banking has also gone up. &#8220;Our rates are probably higher today than they were a year ago,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather than trying to force the issue and go after somebody,&#8221; Rosendal expects Sessions&#8217; aim has been &#8220;scaring off investors and financial institutions, and he sees that as a way to slow down the growth of the industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My impression,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s trying to do.&#8221;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/tag/the-green-solution/">The Green Solution</a>&#160;plans to add three medical marijuana dispensaries&#160;to its fold in Osceola County,&#160;<span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: 1em;"><a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/orlando/news/2018/02/20/3-medical-marijuana-dispensaries-to-open-in.html">Orlando Business Journal</a>&#160;first reported.&#160;The county&#8217;s seat of Kissimmee is located 18 miles south of Orlando, and the 1,500-square-mile county has <a href="http://www.osceola.org/about-osceola-county/general-information/population-statistics.stml">a population north of 330,000</a>.</span></p>
<p>Three medical marijuana dispensary certificates were issued on Feb. 19 to The Green Solution, <a href="http://www.osceola.org/news/3-medical-marijuana-dispensaries-approved-by-osceola-county.stml">Osceola County announced Feb. 20</a>. Following that action, county commissioners enacted a ban on any new marijuana facilities.</p>
<p>The company, which has 15 dispensaries in Colorado, had previously applied for three dispensary certificates in Osceola County pursuant to 2017 rules,&#160;The Green Solution President Trent Woloveck told The Cannabist. They received the required county staff recommendation for the certificates in June 2017.</p>
<p>The recommendation for the issuance of the certificates appeared on the Osceola County Commissioners board agenda on June 19, Wolovneck said. Instead of issuing the certificates, the county instituted a temporary moratorium on marijuana businesses that very day.</p>
<p>His company &#8220;had a vested right to the issuance of the certificates,&#8221; Wolvneck said.</p>

<p>Last week, we reported on a groundbreaking <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/congressional-candidate-smokes-marijuana-campaign-ad/">campaign ad</a> run by Benjamin Thomas Wolf and his team. Wolf is currently in the running for a seat in Congress, hoping to represent the 5th District of Illinois. Wolf is competing against the current congressional face of the 5th District and fellow Democratic Party member Representative Mike Quigley.</p>
<p>The primary elections will take place this month, on March 20. Wolf and his campaign team have been working tirelessly to win over voters in his district. But his most recent campaign ad went viral throughout the nation.</p>
<p>The ad was simple, yet powerful. It was a photograph of Wolf sitting in an armchair in front of a painting of the American flag. Wolf wears professional attire and a calmly defiant expression. He vaguely resembles the iconic <em>Mad Men&#160;</em>protagonist&#160;Don Draper. The difference is that he isn&#8217;t holding a glass of liquor. Instead, in his hand is a joint, complete with wisps of smoke wafting over his head.</p>
<p>Now known as the <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">Cannabis</a> Candidate, Benjamin Thomas Wolf has made this photograph and his openly pro-legalization stance central to his campaign.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>We caught up with him over the phone to discuss his background, his politics and his love of cannabis.</p>
<h2>A Focused Background</h2>
<p>Benjamin Thomas Wolf was born and raised in Kent, Ohio. Both of his parents were public school teachers. They instilled in Wolf and his siblings the value of education and hard work. Wolf remembers sitting at the table doing his homework next to his parents who were grading papers.</p>
<p>&#8220;We watched them work night and day,&#8221; Wolf says. &#8220;I credit my parents for most of my early success in life.&#8221;</p>
<p>But while he had always been a good student, a class trip to Washington, DC when he was in 8th grade proved revelatory.</p>
<p>&#8220;It was magic for me,&#8221; he tells us. &#8220;I remember it like it was yesterday&#8212;standing in front of the Lincoln Memorial, looking out at the reflecting pool, seeing the Washington Monument, the Capitol, the White House, the Jefferson Memorial&#8230;I stood there transfixed. I just remember saying to my friends, &#8216;I feel really good here. I want to live here one day.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>&#8220;Everything in my life was to get back to Washington, DC,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Everything.&#8221;</p>
<p>From that point on, Wolf set out to achieve his goal with a laser focus. He volunteered every summer at various agencies, courts and sheriff departments.</p>
<p>&#8220;I worked through high school and college because I knew that any government agency would want someone who was mature, had good leadership skills and was a complete person,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>Wolf attended college at Kent State University. There, he studied political science and criminal justice. He also joined an ROTC program, where he learned military tactics.</p>
<p>During his senior year, he was accepted to an internship on Capitol Hill. It was called the Washington Program in National Issues. It was an internship that changed his life.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>Benjamin Thomas Wolf: FBI</h2>
<p>Wolf tells us about the most eventful day of his internship. When he was leaving the building to go home for the day, he bumped into a woman who was also leaving.</p>
<p>&#8220;She looked me up and down and asked me what I wanted to do with my life,&#8221; he remembers. &#8220;I said, &#8216;Well, Ma&#8217;am, I want to serve my country one day.&#8217; She said, &#8216;Good&#8217;, handed me a business card, and told me to see her the next week.&#8221;</p>
<p>The woman worked for the FBI. When Wolf went to see her the following week, she gave him the disappointing news that at 22 years old, he was too young to be a special agent. But she quickly made up for it by handing him an application for a classified job.</p>
<p>&#8220;She couldn&#8217;t tell me what it was,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It was like something out of a movie.&#8221;</p>
<p>He turned in the application and consented to a background check. When he graduated, he drove himself to Los Angeles for a well-deserved break. He lived with his uncle and spent his days surfing and enjoying the sunshine. Then he got a phone call from his father. The FBI had been asking his family and friends about him.</p>
<p>&#8220;My dad asked, &#8216;What did you do?''&#8221; Wolf laughs.</p>
<p>Eventually, Wolf received a conditional letter of employment from the Bureau. He completed his training at Quantico and was assigned to a covert unit that investigated espionage, counterintelligence and terrorists.</p>
<h2>Early Career</h2>
<p>He tells us that his first big case was the Robert Hanssen investigation. It was his team that surveilled and trapped the spy for Soviet and Russian intelligence agencies.</p>
<p>He was also one of the first responders at the Pentagon on September 11, 2001, and was among the first 20 agents to volunteer to go to Iraq at the beginning of the war.</p>
<p>In 2003, Wolf was transferred to the State Department as a special agent and a diplomat. In this position, he investigated kidnapping, fraud and trafficking.</p>
<p>Additionally, he served in Interpol for two years and worked in Africa for four.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was in Algeria for two years and Senegal for two years,&#8221; he says. &#8220;[I saw] the beauty and romantic aspects of countries that are often neglected.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Chicago, Cannabis and Congress</h2>
<p>Wolf eventually relocated to Chicago to work towards a Ph.D. in International Psychology. It was in Chicago that his political career took off. And it was all thanks to a city-wide ban on Airbnb.</p>
<p>He started a nonprofit to overturn the ban.&#160; During this time, he started to get increasingly concerned about the city officials and management of Chicago. And about the management of the nation as a whole.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can we talk about cannabis for a minute?&#8221; he suddenly says.</p>
<p>Wolf recounts how he started smoking cannabis two or three years ago in Chicago. He had a asked a friend, who was entrenched in the cannabis community, if he could try it with her. He had never consumed it as a teenager or adult because he didn&#8217;t want to risk his future career in the government.</p>
<p>&#8220;We sat on the couch and shared a small joint. I only had one hit,&#8221; he says. &#8220;We just sat on the couch and laughed and talked and it was just such a wonderful, happy experience.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The government does a great job of vilifying it.&#8221;</p>
<p>While Wolf tells us he uses cannabis &#8220;routinely,&#8221; it&#8217;s not an every-day thing for him. He says he uses a one-hitter &#8220;maybe every other evening.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it makes me a better person,&#8221; he says. &#8220;It makes me calmer, more creative, more empathetic. I couldn&#8217;t be happier to have cannabis in my life.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Pot and Policy</h2>
<p>For Benjamin Thomas Wolf, there was no question that marijuana legalization would be central to his political platform.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am proud to be the Cannabis Candidate,&#8221; he says. &#8220;I knew that I wanted to talk openly about cannabis and I knew that a picture would be powerful.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;s talking, of course, about the campaign ad.</p>
<p>&#8220;My campaign consultant said, &#8216;All you have to do is stand in front of an American flag with a beer; it&#8217;ll win the campaign for you. I said, &#8216;we need to evolve further. I want to stand in front of an American flag smoking a joint.''&#8221;</p>
<p>He tells us that the photo was taken right in his living room. The painting of the American flag is his own.</p>
<p>He goes on to talk about the finer points in his pro-cannabis political stance.</p>
<p>&#8220;Number one, cannabis is medicine. Cannabis is medicine for millions of Americans,&#8221; he starts. &#8220;That is the most important thing to me. Number two, [legalization] is the first step to true criminal justice. And number three, cannabis brings billions of dollars to the states that legalize it. They have billions of dollars for education, for counseling, for drug rehab.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;With the opioid epidemic, cannabis is really the answer.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Optimism In The Current Climate</h2>
<p>Wolf brings up the Trump administration, Jeff Sessions and the Republican majority House and Senate.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a silver lining to this presidency,&#8221; he says confidently. &#8220;People are waking up and organizing. People will vote more. I think in the long run, this is a good thing for us. Trump&#8217;s tenure as president will end. There&#8217;s no doubt about that. In the meantime, if we win, we will go around the country and help other Democrats win to flip the house. Right now, I think the United States is looking for Democratic leadership.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Every day, every hour, every breath I will be fighting this president,&#8221; he pledges.</p>
<h2>Other Issues</h2>
<p>The other issues that Wolf is fighting for are universal healthcare, the environment and gun control.</p>
<p>&#8220;Every person in America deserves health care, both medical and mental,&#8221; he says. To go along with medical and mental health care, he brings up the hot-button issue of civilians owning assault rifles.</p>
<p>&#8220;We released an ad with me holding an AR-15 assault rifle,&#8221; he tells us. &#8220;I carried this in the Iraq War. It&#8217;s not appropriate to sell this weapon to civilians. These are weapons designed to kill tens of people at a time. They have no place in American society. Kids come home and talk about active shooter drills. We have to act quickly as a nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>Healthcare and gun control are polarizing issues among Americans. But Benjamin Thomas Wolf is confident that cannabis brings people together.</p>
<p>&#8220;It really is the common denominator for this campaign,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Cannabis is the one platform that truly extends to all people. It is the most popular platform since starting this campaign. Cannabis legalization transcends all age groups and demographics.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Final Hit: Benjamin Thomas Wolf: The Cannabis Candidate</h2>
<p>Benjamin Thomas Wolf calls cannabis a &#8220;wonderful substance&#8221; and is confident that federal legalization is imminent. His goal for the cannabis-centered campaign, in addition, of course, to win votes, is to help eliminate the stigma that is still attached to consuming the herb.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am a more evolved person, a better father and a better public servant because of cannabis,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>He also credits his progressive political stances on yoga (&#8220;I&#8217;ve done yoga every day for the past 20 years.&#8221;) and attending Burning Man, on the recommendation of his yoga teacher.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the freest a person can be in America,&#8221; he says of the experience.</p>
<p>The primary elections in Illinois take place March 20. Wolf&#8217;s <a href="https://www.wolfforcongress.org/" rel="nofollow">campaign website</a> includes links to voter registrations and lists of locations where one can cast their ballot.</p>
<p>Wolf emphasizes his faith in voting and the democratic system. And he&#8217;s confident that he&#8217;s the right candidate to lead his district.</p>
<p>Our conversation ended with these parting words of wisdom from Congressional Candidate Benjamin Thomas Wolf:</p>
<p>&#8220;Great leadership isn&#8217;t taking people where they <em>want</em> to go,&#8221; he says. &#8220;But where they <em>need</em> to go.&#8221;</p>

(<em>AP</em>) &#8212; A survey of New Hampshire residents shows the majority favors a proposed law that would legalize possession of a small amount of marijuana and growing up to six plants in their home, but wouldn&#8217;t legalize or tax the sale of marijuana.</p>
<p>Support for the legislation is bipartisan: 61 percent of Democrats, 56 percent of Independents and 49 percent of Republicans support it. The findings are based on the latest Granite State Poll conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center.</p>
<p>A majority of the group also show support for keeping the minimum age to buy alcohol at 21 and tobacco at 18 unchanged.</p>
<p>The phone poll of 566 randomly selected adults was conducted between Feb. 10 and Feb. 21. The margin of sampling error was plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.</p>

					<p>While the marijuana legalization battle continues to brew in Federal courts, innovative cannabis startups have begun to crop up.<span id="more-69832"></span></p>
<p>From cannabis-infused household products to mac &#8216;n cheese, cannabis seems to be everywhere. Well, almost. It is only legal for people over the age of 21 in a handful of states like Colorado and Maine. States like these have become breeding grounds for cannabis entrepreneurs racing to become a leader in the new, burgeoning industry. However, less than 5% of blacks are cannabis business owners, compared to 80% of whites.</p>
<p>Ebony Costain, Founder and CEO of BDTNDR, saw another big problem. Budtenders, the individual who serves customers at cannabis distributors, need help. There are too many brands, and not enough education about the products. Many people still wander into cannabis shops looking to &#8220;try&#8221; new things, and rely heavily on the budtender&#8217;s expertise. Ebony developed an idea to be the bridge between the brands, and the budtender. After being selected to participate in CanopyBoulder, a highly competitive cannabis accelerator in Colorado, Ebony&#8217;s vision came to life in 2017.</p>

Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin is also expected to testify.<br>
</p>
<div id="leafly-dfp-ad-widget-mobile-medium-rectangle-1989904866" class="leafly-dfp-ad-container">    </div>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">''The American Legion is all about making sure that veterans are taken care of. We have to find replacements for the opioid epidemic.''<div class="leafly-pull-quote-attribution">Denise Rohan, national commander, American Legion</div></div>
<p>Last week, as a prelude to that testimony, Rohan met the media at a National Press Club discussion about better ways to deliver benefits to the country&#8217;s more than 20 million veterans. In a question and answer session following the formal presentation, Leafly asked Rohan about the stance of the American Legion on medical cannabis.</p>
<p>&#8220;The American Legion is all about making sure that veterans are taken care of,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We have to find replacements for the opioid epidemic that we have in this nation.&#8221;</p>
<p>With that, she deferred to Louis Celli, the American Legion&#8217;s National Director of Veterans Affairs and Rehabilitation. Celli talked about the results of a nationwide survey of veterans and caregivers conducted in Oct. 2017. The survey found that 82 percent of all veterans and caregivers want to have cannabis available as a federally legal treatment. 92 percent support research into medical cannabis, and 1 in 5 veterans report using cannabis to treat their medical or physical conditions.</p>
<p>(Results of that survey were revealed in a press conference on the Hill in November, featuring a bipartisan group of congressmen speaking in support of legalizing medical marijuana, including Minnesota Democratic Congressman Tim Walz, the ranking member of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, and Florida Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz, who has sponsored a bill to reschedule cannabis.)</p>
<p>&#8220;We are calling for additional research into cannabis to find what it may help,&#8221; Celli told Leafly. &#8220;Whether it is for PTSD or inflammation or pain or convulsions&#8212;whatever it is that that might be good for. We just need to know that the American government is focused on trying to find cures for not only veterans but for all Americans. If cannabis, which is a drug, is something that can help, they have to do the research. And right now they can&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>

<h2>How the Legion Found Its Voice</h2>
<p>In the past few years, the American Legion has become an increasingly powerful voice advocating for the rights of veterans when it comes to medical cannabis.</p>
<p>During their national convention in Aug. 2016, the organization released their first medical marijuana-related resolution, which called for the removal of cannabis from Schedule I. The resolution advocated reclassifying it as a drug with potential medical value.</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">When the American Legion speaks on an issue, officials in Washington DC listen.</div>
<p>One year later, the Legion called on the federal government to allow healthcare providers with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to discuss medical cannabis as a treatment option with veterans in states where medical cannabis is legal.</p>
<p>During a meeting of the Legion&#8217;s Veterans Affairs and Rehabilitation Commission in 2017, former American Legion National Commander Bill Detweiler&#8212;chairman of the Legion&#8217;s Traumatic Brain Injury/Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Ad Hoc Committee&#8212;said the Legion would continue to push for alternative treatments for PTSD.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are looking to see what we can do as an organization to urge the Veterans Administration, to urge the military and &#8230; to get congressional funding to find the funds necessary to do the studies [on alternative treatments], even though the studies may be hard,&#8221; Detweiler said at the time. &#8220;Let&#8217;s take a look at things that are available that maybe are not used but could be used&#8212;not to hurt somebody, but to maybe give them a better quality of life. On our end, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re all about.&#8221;</p>
<p>The American Legion was not the only veterans&#8217; group advocating on the issue, but the organization&#8217;s institutional voice&#8212;and its considerable membership and reputation&#8212;seemed to make a difference. In Dec. 2017, the Veterans Administration issued a directive that allowed VA doctors to discuss medical cannabis use with veterans in states where it is legal. VA healthcare providers may discuss, but not recommend. Veterans who wish to include medical cannabis in their personal healthcare program must obtain a recommendation from a healthcare provider outside the VA system, which adds a separate and sometimes substantial cost.</p>

<h2>Change Driven by Member Veterans</h2>
<p>The American Legion does not, as a rule, take radical positions on public policy. Their recent resolutions, as well as the willingness of their leaders to talk about the issue, may be another indication of how mainstream medical marijuana has become&#8212;and how important the issue is to America&#8217;s veterans.</p>
<p>How did the Legion move to embrace a more open position on medical cannabis?</p>
<p>Louis Celli said the organization&#8217;s push for more research came about because of the many anecdotal stories they heard from veterans using cannabis. He said that use of medical cannabis should be &#8220;grounded and founded&#8221; in scientific research the federal government supports. But even that relatively mild position hasn&#8217;t come without criticism from some members. Comments on a section of the American Legion website devoted to their work on medical marijuana show much support, along with comments about marijuana being a gateway drug&#8211;and worse.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not really getting pushback from our decision to support medical marijuana,&#8221; Celli told Leafly. &#8220;But veterans using medical marijuana in states where it is legal are participating in those programs with a feeling of inner guilt, because they were raised through a law enforcement or law abiding type of environment that said cannabis was bad and immoral,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Now they are finding that it is a valid treatment for them and they are having trouble reconciling that.&#8221;</p>

<h2>A Personal Connection</h2>
<p>This will continue to be a big issue for the Legion, but also a personal one for National Commander Denise Rohan. After her presentation, Rohan, who hails from Wisconsin, told Leafly about a Wisconsin veteran who overdosed from the opioids that were prescribed for him.</p>
<p>She hopes that the voices of the more than 2 million American Legion members will make a difference in opening up more research into the medical use of cannabis for veterans. &#8220;Our membership numbers are so important,&#8221; she said. &#8220;They have got to mean something in this fight against the opioid crisis. Let&#8217;s get marijuana tested to find out if it is one of the answers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rohan added that the American Legion has formed a post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) team to examine the emerging solutions for veterans managing the condition. &#8220;Marijuana could be one of them,&#8221; she said. &#8220;We are just saying, &#8216;Let us do a study.&#8217;&#8221;</p>
<h2>PTSD Studies: Already Underway</h2>
<p>A number of PTSD-and-cannabis studies are currently underway, although it remains relatively difficult to obtain approval for such studies in the United States.</p>
<p>Dr. Sue Sisley, a renowned PTSD researcher and frequent speaker at medical marijuana conferences, has developed the first clinical research on medical marijuana for PTSD with the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). Working with a $2.2 million grant from the state of Colorado&#8212;financed by the state&#8217;s cannabis tax revenue&#8212;Sisley&#8217;s group is evaluating the relative efficacy of four different potencies of cannabis for veterans managing PTSD. As of Feb. 12, 42 veterans have enrolled in her clinical trial at the Scottsdale Research Institute in Arizona to evaluate four different potencies of cannabis for symptoms of PTSD. By 2020, her study group expects to go to a phase of research resulting in product going to market.</p>
<p>In Canada, researchers at the University of British Columbia and the licensed cannabis producer Tilray began conducting <a href="https://www.tilray.ca/en/news/ubc-and-tilray-launch-canadas-first-clinical-trial-to-study-medical-cannabis-and-ptsd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a clinical trial</a> to evaluate the therapeutic potential of medical cannabis for PTSD in 2016. The study is scheduled to conclude in the spring of 2018, with results published thereafter. (Full disclosure: Tilray and Leafly are separate companies, but both are owned by the private equity firm Privateer Holdings.)</p>
<p>In Israel, the pioneering cannabis researcher Raphael Mechoulam led a limited study of ten patients with chronic PTSD. That study, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24935052" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published in 2014</a>, found that a twice-daily dose of 5 mg of THC &#8220;caused a statistically significant improvement in global symptom severity, sleep quality, frequency of nightmares, and PTSD hyperarousal symptoms.&#8221;</p>

<div class="leafly-pull-quote">Once home to the Grateful Dead, the cannabis-loving liberal haven now maintains some of California&#8217;s strictest prohibitions against cannabis businesses.</div>
<p>Marin County, located just across the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco, was the home of the Grateful Dead and cannabis-fragrant, clothing-optional music fests in the 1960s. Three decades later, 73 percent of local voters supported Proposition 215. After its passage, the five Green Party members on the Fairfax Town Council in 1997 heartily approved a business license for the Marin Alliance.</p>
<p>And yet today, after another lopsided pro-cannabis vote in Marin, the Marin Alliance remains the only licensed marijuana store in the county of 260,000 residents.</p>
<p>Perhaps more surprisingly, the liberal haven maintains some of California&#8217;s strictest prohibitions against cannabis businesses, which are completely banned in a number of towns and in the unincorporated areas of Marin County.</p>
<p>It seems that Marin, with its picturesque woodlands and marinas, liberal politics and tony boutiques, is far less cannabis-friendly than its voting record suggests.</p>

<h2>No Van Sleeping, No Cannabis Stores</h2>
<p>Perhaps the first cue was years ago when, after pilgrimages of hippies trekked to Marin to witness the Dead live on stage, the county made it a crime to sleep in a van.</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">''This is a very wealthy community. People feel dispensaries will devalue that extremely expensive real estate.''<div class="leafly-pull-quote-attribution">Lynnette Shaw, founder, Marin Alliance for Medical Marijuana</div></div>
<p>These days, Marin County is home to billion-dollar companies like Autodesk software, BioMarin biopharmaceuticals and the luxury home d&#233;cor retailer Restoration Hardware. The average price is a house here is about $1.25 million. And the locals&#8212;at least those in political power&#8212;appear to view cannabis shops and cannabis farming as a threat to the community character, just as loathsome as a Walmart store. (Of which there are none within the county lines.)</p>
<p>When it comes to cannabis, local jurisdictions &#8220;are banning instead of licensing,&#8221; Shaw says. Even in Fairfax, where the vote in favor of Proposition 64 was nearly 78 percent, she is uncertain whether the Town Council will authorize a permit for her to sell cannabis for adult use. Why not? Fear of increased traffic to her dispensary, she says, including talk of her store&#8217;s negative influence on local youth.</p>
<p>&#8220;Keep in mind, this is a very wealthy community,&#8221; Shaw adds. &#8220;People feel dispensaries will devalue that extremely expensive real estate, and they don&#8217;t want cars and commerce. This is socially liberal place but also a closed, cloistered community of hard-working people who want their peace and quiet and they want to be discreet.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would say the electeds here have not gotten in touch with modern times, which is typical for Marin County. It&#8217;s frustrating.&#8221;</p>

<h2>A Cannabis Ban in 2016</h2>
<p>In 2016, after Gov. Jerry Brown approved new state medical marijuana regulations that allowed for local business licensing, Marin County officials considered 10 applications from would-be medicinal dispensary operators. But, in the face of community opposition, supervisors instead voted to ban all cannabis businesses aside from limited, medical-only delivery.</p>
<p>&#8220;We did a blanket prohibition so that we could get our hands around the industry,&#8221; says Inge Lundegaard, a senior county planner who was designated as Marin&#8217;s cannabis program manager. &#8220;How do we regulate it? What do we need to do?&#8221;</p>
<figure id="attachment_59112" style="width: 300px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/27144007/marin-county-liberal-bastion-3.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-59112" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/27144007/marin-county-liberal-bastion-3-300x188.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="188" srcset="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/27144007/marin-county-liberal-bastion-3-300x188.jpg 300w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/27144007/marin-county-liberal-bastion-3-768x480.jpg 768w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/27144007/marin-county-liberal-bastion-3-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/27144007/marin-county-liberal-bastion-3-50x31.jpg 50w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/27144007/marin-county-liberal-bastion-3-1280x800.jpg 1280w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/27144007/marin-county-liberal-bastion-3-960x600.jpg 960w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/27144007/marin-county-liberal-bastion-3-480x300.jpg 480w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/27144007/marin-county-liberal-bastion-3-240x150.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">No smoking, no joking.

<p>Now Marin County and one local city, San Rafael, are working on plans to grant four delivery licenses each for medical sales only, not legal adult use. Apparently, no Marin County municipality wants storefront dispensaries serving walk-in retail customers, nor any commercial cultivation or production.</p>
<p>&#8220;Most cities in the area&#8230;are [adult-use] prohibition across the board,&#8221; Lundegaard says.</p>
<p>Outdoor cannabis growing is prohibited in the county and its cities, which include Belvedere, Corte Madera, Fairfax, Larkspur, Mill Valley, Novato, Ross, San Anselmo, San Rafael, Sausalito and Tiburon. Novato permits two cannabis testing labs. But commercial nurseries, cannabis microbusinesses, manufacturing, distribution aren&#8217;t allowed anywhere. Neither are permits for special events with on-site consumption.</p>
<p>Small personal indoor cultivation is generally allowed in Marin, but people wanting to buy cannabis are generally expected to head south to San Francisco, north to Sonoma County or east to Berkeley or Oakland.</p>

<h2>Legalize It Now! But Not Here</h2>
<p>In 2016, 32-year-old Nurit Raphael, a local delivery license applicant, and 72-year-old Yvette Wakefield, a cancer patient who uses cannabis, got a sense of the county&#8217;s marijuana conundrum at a community meeting at a Mill Valley restaurant.</p>
<p>Raphael and Wakefield remember a resident at the meeting, intended to rally support for permitting a dispensary just outside city limits, delivering a pro-cannabis soliloquy. The same man then said there needed to be a local dispensary ban.</p>
<p>&#8220;He said he was a [medical marijuana] card holder but he doesn&#8217;t want a dispensary in his neighborhood,&#8221; Wakefield said.</p>
<p>Other than a recent delivery of cannabis CBD creams and tinctures from Raphael, Wakefield generally relies on friends of friends to furtively supply her with organically grown flower for her pain from cancer treatments. She is angry that medical cannabis remains hard to come by for many Marin residents&#8212;and is furious that the county isn&#8217;t taking steps to accommodate adult use as well.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they&#8217;re all hypocrites&#8212;it&#8217;s a very Marin thing,&#8221; she fumed. &#8220;I think they&#8217;re afraid of any negative feedback.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Marin County: 70% &#8216;Yes&#8217; on Prop. 64</h2>

<h2>What Is a Suitable Site?</h2>
<p>County planner Lundegaard says Marin&#8217;s cannabis challenges are, in a word, <em>complicated</em>.</p>
<p>While local voters strongly support marijuana liberalization, she says, the county has few sites suitable for cannabis businesses. Moreover, there is intense community pressure to preserve the county&#8217;s greenbelts and charming town avenues.</p>
<p>So in Marin, it&#8217;s yes on cannabis legalization&#8212;and decidedly Not In My Backyard.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/america-mourns-passing-of-dennis-peron-father-of-medical-marijuana"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/25102505/dennis-person-ca-legalization-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">America Mourns Passing of Dennis Peron, Father of Medical Marijuana</div></div></a></div>
<h2>Protecting Small-Town Charm</h2>
<p>&#8220;The key issues in Marin and the direction from our constituents is to keep our rural environment with respect to open space and small-town character,&#8221; Lundegaard says. &#8220;The unincorporated areas have very limited commercial and industrial spaces, and with community plans in place to protect open space and community character, that limits the potential sites.&#8221;</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">Local towns want to permit cannabis delivery, but not storefronts.</div>
<p>Marin County residents can only purchase cannabis for adult use from delivery services that come in from licensed businesses outside the county. Those products can be dropped off in only four cities that legally permit delivery: Belvedere, Corte Madera, Larkspur and Sausalito. The county and other cities either permit medicinal delivery only or have yet to establish policies.</p>
<p>Raphael recently secured a California license as a &#8220;non-storefront&#8221; retailer, meaning she can operate her ONA.life delivery service out of the city of San Rafael. But her permit is only temporary, subject to her winning one of the city&#8217;s four delivery licenses in a lottery later this spring. She has also applied for one of Marin County&#8217;s four delivery slots as a backup option.</p>
<p>Based on neighbors&#8217; resistance to the siting of medical marijuana dispensaries, though, she doesn&#8217;t expect a warm embrace for adult use sales&#8212;even if it&#8217;s discreet home delivery. &#8220;I think because there was such a negative reaction, it scared the county&#8212;and I think everyone is scared to do recreational right now.&#8221;</p>

<h2>Taking Heat From the Community</h2>
<p>In a county in which 56 percent of voters are Democrats, 23 percent have no party preference and fewer than 17 percent are Republicans (with the Greens holding at 1 percent), Lew Tremaine has little love for most local elected officials when it comes to cannabis policy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marin is schizophrenic,&#8221; says Tremaine, a former Fairfax mayor who was a founding board member of Marin Clean Energy, a local utility promoting renewable energy options to battle climate change. &#8220;It has this image of itself as a liberal bastion. But when you look at the local officials who get elected, they are moderate Democrats at best.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a bridge too far for them to want to take the heat from people in the community who don&#8217;t want to see&#8221; licensed cannabis businesses,&#8221; Tremaine adds. For his part, Tremaine recently began working as the Marin Alliance&#8217;s chief operating officer.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/industry/marijuana-dispensary-design-tips"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/22143312/megan-stone-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Interior Designer Megan Stone&#8217;s 10 Best Dispensary Design Tips</div></div></a></div>
<h2>Lynnette Shaw Fights the Feds</h2>
<p>In 2011, a year after Tremaine retired as mayor, the town of Fairfax rallied political support for Shaw&#8217;s dispensary after it was shuttered by federal authorities. Melinda Haag, who was then the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California, filed a property seizure notice. Haag argued that the dispensary was in breach of federal law&#8212;and a threat to children&#8212;because it was selling cannabis within 1,000 feet of a Little League baseball field.</p>
<p>Four years later, in 2015, Shaw won a federal court battle restoring her right to distribute cannabis. That verdict was made possible by Congressional legislation preventing federal interference with state-permitted medical marijuana laws&#8212;the Rohrabacher-Farr budget amendment. The Marin Alliance reopened last year at the same Fairfax location.</p>
<p>Peter Lacques, an employment rights attorney and the current Fairfax mayor, said the town viewed the federal prosecution of the Marin Alliance as unwarranted and &#8220;extremely heavy-handed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even so, Mayor Lacques says he isn&#8217;t sure the Fairfax Town Council wants the Marin Alliance to expand from medical sales to serve adult-use customers. He says the community of 7,500 residents is also hesitant to consider adding additional cannabis businesses.</p>
<p>&#8220;We will be taking input from members of the community, parents and consumers,&#8221; Lacques says. &#8220;We will look at what makes sense for Fairfax&#8230; There is an irony in that the population overwhelmingly supports the legalization or decriminalization of cannabis, but there is a tension between that support and allowing open sales of marijuana.&#8221;</p>
<h2>&#8216;Decrim, not Corporatization&#8217;</h2>
<p>As some residents and wary merchants complain that cannabis business expansion threatens to bring vehicle or pedestrian traffic, or clouds of smoke outside cannabis retail stores, the local drug treatment community has also emerged as a political force.</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">''People here voted for it because they didn&#8217;t want to go to jail for it, because its enforcement was racist&#8230; So you let people possess it. But you don&#8217;t turn it into an industry.''<div class="leafly-pull-quote-attribution">Don Carney, director, Marin County Youth Court</div></div>
<p>Don Carney, director of the Marin County Youth Court, was one local resident who spoke vehemently against the county&#8217;s consideration of new permits for medical marijuana dispensaries. The Youth Court, affiliated with the YMCA, features teen juries that recommend non-punitive &#8220;harm-reduction&#8221; remedies for youths with minor criminal infractions, about two-thirds of which are for drug use or possession.</p>
<p>Carney says he believes medical cannabis has &#8220;great capacity&#8221; for healing. He describes himself as ardent opponent of drug war policies, including classifying marijuana as Schedule 1 narcotic and arresting people for possession of cannabis. But he voted against Proposition 64. &#8220;I was in favor of decriminalization, not corporatization,&#8221; he says.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a lot of people in the county voted for this because (cannabis) was something they did in their youth,&#8221; Carney says. &#8220;They voted for it because they didn&#8217;t want to go to jail for it, because its enforcement was racist&#8230; So you let people possess it. But you don&#8217;t turn it into an industry.&#8221;</p>
<p>Carney says the mere presence of dispensaries in Marin would &#8220;lower the perception of harm&#8221; for marijuana. But he is fine with delivery, serving residents at their homes and out of view. That way, he says, there can be no central gathering places or storefronts &#8220;for a three-year-old to walk by and get normalized&#8221; by the sight of cannabis sales in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>A similar argument is offered by Mill Valley City Council member Jessica Jackson Sloan, a human rights attorney who handles appeals for death row inmates and advocates for criminal justice reforms to reduce prison populations. Last November, she <a href="http://www.marinij.com/article/NO/20171119/NEWS/171119773" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the Marin Independent Journal</a> newspaper&#160;that restricting cannabis businesses was necessary to &#8220;protect the youth from exposure.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mill Valley is not prohibiting cannabis,&#8221; Sloan told the Independent Journal. &#8220;Residents can grow it at home, head out of town to pick some up. There are no laws against people using it in a responsible manner. We are not prohibiting people from using it recreationally.&#8221;</p>

<h2>People Here Will Fight Over Paint</h2>
<p>To understand Marin&#8217;s cannabis angst, perhaps some context is useful. Consider Mill Valley and its current civic crisis over the bright new paint on a downtown fashion boutique, <em>Branded, </em>which rests amid Victorian and English Tudor storefronts.</p>
<p>Planning officials were alarmed when the owner chose a shade of turquoise called Hawaiian Beach Dream&#8212;an intoxicating color clash in violation of city codes. &#8220;The fate of the vibrant color palette&#8230;remains in limbo,&#8221; <a href="http://www.marinij.com/article/NO/20180216/NEWS/180219814" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported&#160;the Independent Journal</a>.</p>
<p>Recently, Nurit Raphael, the cannabis delivery business operator, stepped into boutique to tell the owner she firmly supported the merchant in exercising her rights to Hawaiian Beach Dream turquoise&#8212;even in Mill Valley.</p>
<p>Then Raphael led an impromptu tour of the town, describing how, someday, she would like to see a cannabis dispensary accepted in the elegant surroundings.</p>
<p>&#8220;People think there is going to be a cloud of smoke, people hanging out in parking lots and lot of negative attention,&#8221; Raphael said. &#8220;But that&#8217;s not true. I mean how cool would it be to have a little dispensary here? It would be so clean cut, with so much to offer in aesthetics.&#8221;</p>

<p>Most of the time, cops are the ones busting people for <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a>. But now, a Mississippi police chief allegedly caught smoking weed on camera knows what it feels like to be on the other end of prohibition laws.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://www.wdam.com/story/37607343/video-allegedly-shows-ms-police-chief-smoking-weed" rel="nofollow">local news outlet WDAM</a> in Lumberton, Mississippi, a video has surfaced showing what appears to be Police Chief Shane Flynt smoking weed out of a broken <a href="https://hightimes.com/culture/stoned-science-the-most-effective-way-to-clear-a-bowl/">bowl</a> and drinking beer.</p>
<p>At one point in the video, Flynt bragged about being a <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/police-officers-suspended-weed-edibles/">cop&#160;who loves weed</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;If this ain&#8217;t no cool shit,&#8221; he said in the recording. &#8220;Who the coolest here? Me! I&#8217;m the coolest here.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>He added: &#8220;I&#8217;m the only chief of police in Lumberton that likes to smoke weed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The man in the video is wearing normal clothes. But there appears to be a police uniform hanging up behind him.</p>
<p>So far, it is unclear exactly who filmed the video. It&#8217;s also unclear who leaked it. Authorities think it may have been filmed sometime last winter.</p>
<p>Somewhere along the line, however, it appears that city officials got their hands on the video. In mid-February, Chief Flynt was suspended with pay. At the time, city leaders and the mayor said the suspension was for personnel matters. But it now appears that it may have had something to do with the weed-smoking video.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Shortly after being suspended, Flynt submitted his resignation, but it was not accepted. He remains on suspension as officials investigate the video further.</p>
<h2>Final Hit: Police Chief Allegedly Caught Smoking Weed On Camera</h2>
<p>It appears that Flynt has not been disciplined beyond the suspension. Similarly, it appears that no legal actions have yet been taken against him.</p>
<p>The video has elicited a range of responses from city leaders. Many are disturbed by what the video depicts. For example, Mayor Quincy Rogers called the footage &#8220;quite disturbing,&#8221; and said he was &#8220;still trying to get over this video.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others are more sympathetic. &#8220;I currently support the police chief, yes I do,&#8221; board of alderman member Jonathan Griffith told reporters in Lumberton. &#8220;Everyone in life makes mistakes. And, so, it is our intent to make sure we investigate this matter properly.&#8221;</p>
<p>Even Flynt has weighed in. The suspended police chief allegedly caught smoking weed on camera took to Facebook to publish a statement:</p>
<p>&#8220;Please know that one video, one mistake, does not define the person I am, my moral or ethical values,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;Just a thought. Where would we all be if we all had hidden cameras in our home? What would our neighbors, preachers, co-workers, friends, etc., think of our conversations?&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>Ultimately, the entire drama can certainly be viewed as yet another instance in which <a href="https://hightimes.com/activism/the-biggest-prohibitionist-lie/">prohibition</a> creates problems where there otherwise aren&#8217;t any. And who knows, maybe if cops get a taste of their own war-on-drugs medicine more of them will get on board with legalization.</p>
<p>Either way, Flynt should consider himself lucky. He&#8217;s on paid leave for doing the exact same thing that millions of others&#8212;especially poor people and <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/nypd-facing-criticism-racial-disparity-marijuana-arrests/">people of color</a>&#8212;have been arrested and imprisoned for.</p>

They argue this is faster than making someone come in for a blood test, and it might not require a warrant like a blood test does. The only problem? A saliva test is essentially <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/don-t-hold-your-breath-for-a-marijuana-breathalyzer-test/">useless</a>.</p><p>A saliva test can certainly find out if someone has consumed marijuana the day they&#8217;re tested, but there is absolutely no way for it to determine if someone is impaired. Medical marijuana users who have high tolerances may be found to have a ton of cannabis compounds present in their saliva&#8212;which may be because they consumed cannabis 10 hours before the test&#8212;without being even remotely impaired.</p><p>&#8220;This is not measuring impairment. It&#8217;s unscientific,&#8221; Chloe White, policy director for the Vermont chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, told the Burlington Free Press.&#160;&#8220;I don&#8217;t think anyone is in favor of impaired driving on the road. Impaired driving is bad&#8230; We want to make sure that people&#8217;s constitutional rights are protected.&#8221;</p><p>Luckily, Vermont has not backed the <a href="http://www.westword.com/news/marijuana-driving-limits-in-colorado-have-no-scientific-basis-aaa-study-finds-7891197">equally unscientific</a> method of setting a limit on how much THC someone can have in their blood before they&#8217;re declared impaired, as Colorado and Washington have, but the saliva test is still a step in the wrong direction.</p><p>It&#8217;s fair to say it&#8217;s very difficult to determine the best way to determine when people are driving after consuming too much cannabis to be driving safely, but the answer is most definitely not to turn to pseudoscience. The best thing police officers can do at this point is to be highly trained for observing signs of intoxication. There will likely soon be a time when science can determine intoxication more accurately, but we&#8217;re not there yet, and we shouldn&#8217;t pretend to be.</p><p><em>[Photo by dwightsghost/Flickr]</em></p><div style="text-align: center">  <noscript><a href="http://the420times.com/openx/www/delivery/ck.php?n=a6be1a87&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE" target="_blank"><img src="http://the420times.com/openx/www/delivery/avw.php?zoneid=2&amp;cb=INSERT_RANDOM_NUMBER_HERE&amp;n=a6be1a87" border="0" alt=""></a></noscript></div></section>', '2018-02-28 00:00:00', 'https://the420times.com/2018/02/vermont-is-ignoring-science-to-target-high-drivers/', 11, '2018-03-01 00:30:25.658519', '2018-03-06 04:12:39.302561', 12, NULL, NULL, 0, 'vermont-is-ignoring-science-to-target-high-drivers');

(AP) &#8212; <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/tag/north-dakota-health-department/">North Dakota&#8217;s Health Department</a> on Wednesday began accepting proposals from laboratory companies that want to test medical marijuana in the state.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the next step in efforts to establish a system for the drug <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2016/11/10/north-dakota-medical-marijuana-backers-surprised/67282/">approved by state voters in November 2016</a>. The selected lab will test marijuana for contaminants including pesticides and to ensure that levels of the intoxicant THC are accurately labeled.</p>
<p>Last summer, seven laboratory companies with experience in other states expressed interest in being a part of North Dakota&#8217;s program. The Health Department had requested non-binding letters of intent so it could ensure a lab would be available for testing, since in-state labs focus mainly on agricultural and environmental testing.</p>

<p>Those seven labs, which the state did not identify, and others can now formally apply through 3 p.m. on April 19.</p>
<p>North Dakota law allows the use of medical marijuana for 17 medical conditions, along with terminal illnesses. The 2017 Legislature crafted regulations that Gov. Doug Burgum approved last April. The drug is expected to be available to qualifying patients late this year.</p>
<p>Administrative rules covering such things as testing, security requirements and transportation regulations were approved in January by the State Health Council, which advises the Health Department. Those rules go before the Legislature&#8217;s Administrative Rules Committee for review on March 12.</p>
<p>The Health Department expects to accept applications from medical marijuana manufacturing facilities in late spring or early summer, before moving on to application periods for dispensaries, patients and caregivers.</p>

<p>Manufacturers will be responsible for paying the cost of medical marijuana testing.</p>
<p>&#8220;While the state isn&#8217;t paying for the cost of compliance tests, we recognize that testing prices impact the final cost of the products,&#8221; said Medical Marijuana Division Director Jason Wahl. &#8220;Therefore, proposals received will be evaluated on cost, and costs for tests will be included in the contract.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Health Department two weeks ago selected a Florida-based company to implement a monitoring system for North Dakota&#8217;s medical marijuana program. BioTrackTHC, which has similar contracts in six other states, was chosen from among six proposals.</p>

<p>Inside the vehicle, Border Patrol agents found 52 packages of <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a>. Altogether, the seized pot weighed in at more than 1,200 pounds. Officials estimated&#160;the street value of the weed to be nearly one million dollars.</p>
<p>Officers caught and arrested two teenagers at the site of the crash. One of those arrested is a juvenile. The Cameron County District Attorney&#8217;s Office has charged the two teens with narcotics smuggling.</p>
<p>Letisia&#160;Camarillo is the Agent in Charge of the Fort Brown Border Patrol Station. She said that last week&#8217;s arrests are another example of drug smuggling operations taking advantage of young people.</p>
<p>&#8220;Juveniles in our community are being exploited. They are making decisions that put themselves at risk and they don&#8217;t understand the consequences,&#8221; Camarillo said.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>&#8220;Juveniles are viewed as cheap and disposable labor, a means for <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/mexican-cartels-moving-drug-crops-into-oaxaca-state/">cartels to push their illicit product</a>. They constantly recruit to replace kids that are arrested and prosecuted. It&#8217;s a horrific cycle and we need to come together to educate our children about the consequences.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the arrests, the Border Patrol turned the confiscated pot over to the Drug Enforcement Administration.</p>
<h2>Will A Wall Stop The Weed?</h2>

<p>President Trump has called for a wall to be built along our southern border with Mexico since the campaign trail. The wall, he says, would stem the flow of drugs and undocumented immigrants across the border.</p>
<p>Opponents of the president say a wall just won&#8217;t work. They might be right.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>A former pot smuggler <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2018/01/25/texas-smugglers-say-trumps-border-wall-wouldnt-stop-immigrants-drugs-p/" rel="nofollow">told the Texas Tribune</a> that a wall would not have stopped his operation. The Starr County resident said he transported 50 tons of weed per year across the border over his career.</p>
<p>But he drove semi rigs right through Border Patrol checkpoints. Government records show he&#8217;s not alone. Most illegal drugs smuggled across the border come through legal ports of entry.</p>
<p>Another former smuggler also says building a wall won&#8217;t stop contraband from coming across the border.&#160;Norma Armendariz of Laredo raked in thousands of dollars bringing undocumented immigrants across the border.</p>
<p>Far too many Border Patrol agents and Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials are corrupt for a wall to work. She says it was easy to find someone willing to take a bribe.</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;Texas Teens Busted Trying To Smuggle $1 Million Worth of Weed</h2>
<p>We don&#8217;t know how effective Trump&#8217;s wall will be. Especially with smugglers using aircrafts and tunnels to get their weed across the border. Construction companies have built prototype designs in San Diego for review by the Department of Homeland Security. The president has been pressuring Congress to provide funding for the massive project.</p>

<h2><b>Strain Profile</b></h2>
<p><b>The Science: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Due to the mysterious genetics, we need to drill down on her active cannabinoids and terpenes to understand Sonoma Coma&#8217;s potency. Tested by </span><a href="http://www.cblabstesting.com/test-results/sonoma-coma-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">CB Labs</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> in Oct. 2017, results indicate this specific batch Sonoma Coma had a total THC content of 24.11 percent, which included 0.28 percent activated THC and 23.83 percent &#160;THCa. As for Sonoma Coma&#8217;s flavor and aroma, her overall essence was dictated by the following terpenes: d</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8211;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Limonene &#8211; 2.4 mg/g, &#946;-caryophyllene &#8211; .78 mg/g, &#946;-myrcene &#8211; .58 mg/g, and &#945;-Pinene &#8211; .37 mg/g.</span></p>
<p><b>Appearance:</b> <span style="font-weight: 400">Like Bob Ross&#8217; happy trees, these plump little nuggets look like slightly-too-perfect trees. Covered in yellow, green, and orange hues, her pistils climb up from a wide base toward her smaller and narrower tops. </span></p>
<p><b>Consistency: </b><b>&#160;</b><b>Sonoma Coma </b><span style="font-weight: 400">falls about midway through the density scale. It&#8217;s a Sativa, so it leans toward the fluffier, airier side of the consistency spectrum. Sticky and gooey, those caught ill-prepared without scissors or a grinder may have issues dissecting this strain with their bare fingers.</span></p>
<p><b>Scent: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">Whoever was behind the </span><b>Sonoma Coma </b><span style="font-weight: 400">did a wonderful job with the aroma profile and flavor. Open the bag to find a subtle sour smell, enticing you to further investigate. Upon further review, you&#8217;ll likely find the sour notes give way to a more tropical scent spectrum &#8211; mango and pineapple, etc.</span></p>
<p><b>Taste: </b><b>&#160;</b><b>Sonoma Coma&#8217;s </b><span style="font-weight: 400">aroma doesn&#8217;t really translate to her flavor profile. Sure, the sweet fruitiness will be here and there, but the tropical smells tend to make room for a sharper, spicier, hashy, earthy taste. That&#8217;s to be expected, given smoke carries the flavor and all, but the dichotomy between the aroma and taste in this strain is interesting.</span></p>
<p><b>Effect: </b><b>&#160;</b><span style="font-weight: 400">If you take a look above, you&#8217;ll notice </span><b>Sonoma Coma </b><span style="font-weight: 400">is between the 17 percent and 25 percent for THC content. That&#8217;s pretty high. Get ready for an inspired adventure, perhaps even a mind-altering voyage, dependent on your intake. Be wary, anxiety and/or paranoia is a potential outcome of overindulgence.</span></p>
<p><b>Strain Background: </b><span style="font-weight: 400">A Sativa for the record books, </span><b>Sonoma Coma</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> was originally cultivated by Happy Lil Trees. A two-time winner in the Sativa category, </span><b>Sonoma Coma</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> won first place as best Sativa at the 2012 LA Medical Cannabis Cup, and took home the third-place trophy at the 2011 San Francisco Cannabis Cup. </span></p>
<p><b>Medical Uses</b><span style="font-weight: 400">: </span><span style="font-weight: 400">For those with an elevated tolerance level in search of kickstarting their creative juices, </span><b>Sonoma Coma </b><span style="font-weight: 400">is right up your alley. But if you&#8217;re a first-time smoker or occasional toker, you might want to consider a more sedative strain. Sonoma Coma typically helps mitigate mild bouts of depression, nausea, and joint discomfort.</span></p>

<h2>What Are Mycorrhizae?</h2>
<p>Mycorrhizae are a class of fungi that thrive in symbiotic relationships with the root systems of plants. This partnership is common throughout the plant kingdom, and is often integral to the health of crops around the world. It may even have been key to the initial spread of plants on land&#8212;evidence suggests that mycorrhizal relationships date back more than 230 million years, to when plants were still working to make the transition from sea to land.</p>

<p>Mycorrhizae may have made that transition more seamless because these fungi make life just a little easier for plants. For instance, mycorrhizae that pair with plants like cannabis penetrate the root, sharing in its nutrients.

<h2>Benefits of Mycorrhizae</h2>
<p>When mycorrhizae colonize a plant root, they proceed to branch out into the soil around it. &#8220;You can almost envision mycorrhizae as a series of secondary roots, coming off of the plant root,&#8221; says Jason Steinman, production manager at the plant nutrient supplier Hydrodynamics International. &#8220;Except those secondary roots are actually strands of fungus.&#8221;</p>

<p>Those additional branches serve an important purpose, expanding the surface area and reach of a partner plant&#8217;s root system. More surface area means that the roots are in contact with more soil, more water, and more nutrients, so that they can make the most of the resources that surround them. The result is that plants colonized with mycorrhizal fungi have been found to be more resistant to factors like stress and drought.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you have plants that are in a drought scenario, you will see leaves that are drooping or falling off, and you&#8217;ll eventually see the whole plant die,&#8221; says Steinman. &#8220;In plants treated with mycorrhizae, you&#8217;ll see that much more slowly than in their untreated counterparts. And that&#8217;s because before the drought, they were able to make the most of the resources in their environment, so they&#8217;re more prepared for lean times.&#8221;</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/home-cannabis-cultivation-laws-a-state-by-state-guide"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/29195631/home-cannabis-cultivation-laws-a-state-by-state-guide-480x300.png"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Home Cannabis Cultivation and Possession Laws: A State-by-State Guide</div></div></a></div>
<p>It&#8217;s not just expansion that improves the health of plants that have mycorrhizal sidekicks, though. Some mycorrhizae can also help to break down nutrients found in soil, such as phosphates. That makes it easier for their partner plant to absorb those nutrients, the same way cutting up a meal into smaller bites makes it easier for us to eat. The presence of mycorrhizae can even help ward off plant pathogens like molds, making it possible to fight fungi with fungi.</p>
<h2>Introducing Mycorrhizae to a Cannabis Grow</h2>
<p>Chances are, whatever soil you&#8217;re growing in already has some mycorrhizae in it. But just because these fungi are present in a growing medium doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re making the plants in it healthier. Mycorrhizae spores&#8212;the fungal answer to seeds&#8212;need to come into direct contact with a plant&#8217;s roots to colonize them. And since the spores are fairly large, they don&#8217;t travel easily through soil.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/growing/building-organic-soil-for-cannabis"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/19151830/organic-soil-for-growing-cannabis-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">What Is Super Soil and How Do You Make It?</div></div></a></div>
<p>That&#8217;s where mycorrhizae-rich supplements like Clonex Root Maximizer can come in handy. In outdoor grows where plants are susceptible to the whims of weather, a thriving mycorrhizae population can render plants hardy enough to make it through trying times. Even in indoor growing operations where conditions are more tightly controlled and monitored, mycorrhizae can provide an &#8220;insurance policy&#8221; of sorts against unforeseen malfunctions.</p>

<p>Depending on a grower&#8217;s methods, mycorrhizae may be more than an insurance policy. In organic grows, for instance, these fungi are instrumental in breaking down organic material into small enough parts that it can be effectively put to use by cannabis and other crops.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re planting row after row of flowers or a couple plants for personal use (and <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/home-cannabis-cultivation-laws-a-state-by-state-guide">consult the laws in your area</a> on that front, of course), mycorrhizae can give your cannabis crop a boost. As events like droughts become increasingly common, this little-known partnership between fungus and plant could be the difference between a successful growing season and hoping for better luck next year.</p>

<p>While that&#8217;s satisfying their large institutional shareholders, it&#8217;s not enough to lure more general investors drawn to flashier electric-vehicle commodities, as well as to <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/02/06/marijuana-stocks-swedish-investors/98315/">stocks riding the marijuana and cryptocurrency booms</a>.</p>
<p>Large producers such as Barrick Gold Corp. and Goldcorp Inc. surged in 2016 as they emerged from a multi-year downturn. Since then, they&#8217;ve largely decoupled from bullion, which has continued to rise, and are trading at the cheapest versus the Dow Jones Industrial Average in more than a year. Investors seeking gold exposure are preferring exchange-traded funds, all at a time when money is pouring into lithium and cobalt companies that have plugged into the rechargeable-battery rush.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the message from the BMO metals and mining conference, where 1,400 bankers, miners and investors have gathered over four days of meetings hoping to find opportunities.</p>

<p>&#8220;Right now, gold has been so boring and asleep that nobody cares,&#8221; David Harquail, chief executive officer of precious-metal royalty and streaming company Franco-Nevada Corp. and chairman of the World Gold Council, said in an interview from the conference in Florida. &#8220;It&#8217;s the first time, even my schedule isn&#8217;t filled.&#8221;</p>
<p>The odd mid-sized deal aside, participants say interest in gold mergers and acquisitions remains lackluster, with large players still not ready to do big deals even as their reserve life shrinks, and capital still tight for small explorers and developers.</p>
<p>Asked why gold companies aren&#8217;t capturing more of gold&#8217;s move higher, Harquail referred to the lack of commodity-specific funds in the space. &#8220;There&#8217;s really no precious metal funds of size left because the performance has been so poor,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The only place that has real money is the generalist funds. &#8221;</p>

<p>The dearth of M&amp;A is indicative of lack of growth presented by gold companies, said Pierre Lassonde, the chairman of Franco-Nevada. He thinks this will persist for another 12 to 18 months, at which point investors will demand growth. But for now, the gold price has &#8220;gone nowhere&#8221; over the last five years and there are plenty of other flashier commodities attracting generalist interest.</p>
<p>&#8220;While you&#8217;ve had the cryptocurrencies, you&#8217;ve had cannabis, you&#8217;ve had all kinds of industry exploding and the gold price flat, it&#8217;s like watching paint dry. Why would anyone get excited?&#8221;</p>
<p>Interest that was once focused on gold has shifted to so-called battery metals this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Look at this sched,&#8221; Cobalt 27 Capital Corp. CEO Anthony Milewski said in a rapid-fire interview squeezed between 30 potential-investor meetings. &#8220;There&#8217;s not a single blank space in three days.&#8221;</p>
<hr>

<hr>
<p>Last week, Milewski said his company was in talks with multiple parties interested in securing cobalt supplies, including battery makers, automobile manufacturers and Chinese conglomerates. On Tuesday, he said industrial and trading companies are also starting to invest directly in Cobalt 27 equity. Meanwhile, increasing numbers of investors are interested in buying shares as &#8220;a proxy for adoption of electric vehicles.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gold producer Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. is dusting off its idled cobalt land holdings in Canada after receiving multiple inquiries, CEO Sean Boyd said at the conference.</p>
<p>Both Barrick and Newmont, the top two gold producers, said they are feeling no pressure from large investors to make big acquisitions. Newmont CEO Gary Goldberg has previously talked about the need to attract more generalist investors through dividends.</p>
<p>&#8220;The generalist investor is not quite back yet but we&#8217;re starting to get nibbles,&#8221; said Egizio Bianchini, the outgoing co-head of global mining for BMO Capital Markets, who has led the conference since its inception 27 years ago.</p>

<p>Still, that&#8217;s nothing compared with the mood surrounding electric-vehicle commodities, said Bianchini, who is leaving the bank to become vice chairman of Ivanhoe Mines Ltd., the Vancouver-based miner formed by billionaire Robert Friedland. &#8220;The new-age metals lunch was packed. We did Battery 101 on Sunday and had over 400 people.&#8221;</p>
<p>A friend of Bianchini&#8217;s for more than 30 years, Friedland has long said that electric vehicles have the potential to upend the balance of power between mining companies and customers, while driving demand.</p>
<p>While investors center their attention on giant tech stocks, along with companies riding the bitcoin, marijuana and electrification booms, &#8220;gold will have its day,&#8221; Bianchini said.</p>
<p>For Harquail, that may require the precious metal to reach at least $1,500 an ounce, from about $1,320 now.</p>
<p>&#8220;Generalists don&#8217;t invest in shrinking companies,&#8221; said Randall Oliphant, a director of Vancouver-based New Gold Inc.</p>

											    	<p>The flight from Seattle to Las Vegas, Nevada, was a short one; I had made the trip over a dozen times in the last year, but one was standing out in my head above the others. Vegas had become something of a mecca for cannabis trade shows, and there seemed to be a new industry event popping up in Sin City every other month.</p>
<p>In spite of its apparent liberal leanings, Nevada&#8217;s approach to cannabis had been notoriously conservative in the past. Possessing even a tenth of a gram would catch you a felony in the state until November of 2000 when medical use for chronically ill patients was approved, setting the groundwork for full recreational adult use on January 1, 2017.</p>
<p>I came here for funding three years ago when my own cannabis business was beginning to take off. I had started a lifestyle brand based around the dabbing scene that was coming online in 2012; the medical market was already in full swing on the West Coast and starting to produce its own cannabis rockstars. I jokingly dubbed them Dabstars and began posting mugshot-style photos with small biographies for captions to our social media. Before I knew it, we were touring the country and reaching millions of cannabis enthusiasts each week.</p>
<p>The plane screeched to a landing at McCarran International airport, jolting me from my thoughts. Duane Woods and Nick Woodward of Ekho Solutions greeted me at the terminal. They had started as liquor reps for Jesse James Bourbon, and we&#8217;d spent some wild times on the road together in the past. The boys lit up a pair of oversized joints and began passing them around the car.</p>

<p>I grimaced as we passed the Wynn. It was here that I met our New York investors for the first time. They had flown me out in style, picking me up in a limousine and renting the top floor of the luxury hotel. An attempt at shock and awe, which had admittedly worked on this small town boy from the mountains of Colorado. What followed was an unparalleled weekend of drugs and debauchery not fit for print in any magazine worth its ink. Suffice it to say, I nearly lost everything that trip and ended up <em>rohypnoled</em> and broke with a $10,000 hospital bill for my troubles. The whole thing had left me with a kind of Vegas PTSD that still had not worn off in the years since&#8230;</p>
<p>A client scored us a suite at Treasure Island and we headed up to cover the smoke detectors for a quick dab sesh before heading out into the streets. This was a work trip, but you wouldn&#8217;t know it from the look of us. Cannabis was not for the Harvard MBA&#8212;these were normal, red-blooded Americans who saw cannabis as their last real chance at the American dream.</p>
<p>The federal government had allowed the cannabis industry to flourish under the Obama administration, even enacting federal protections for states with cannabis laws on the books. These protections would later be altered by Trump-appointed Attorney General Jeff Sessions, further muddying the waters.</p>

<p>The mixed legal environment makes it tricky for up-and-coming brands looking to branch out of their home states and onto the national scene. Federal laws still prohibit and harshly punish interstate trafficking, ultimately reducing the industry to regional factions, with each legal state boasting a handful of breakout brands. Nevada was a new slice in the pie and many of these brands now found themselves in Las Vegas, entrenched in backdoor negotiations with those lucky enough to have scored a license to produce in the state.</p>
<p>Vegas itself is no ordinary city. Annual revenue here exceeded 25 billion dollars in 2016, catering to a staggering 40 million tourists each year. For an up-and-coming cannabis brand looking to be the next Coke or Pepsi, Vegas is a chance to expose their product to a national market.</p>
<p>Founded in 1905 from the deserts of what once was Mexico, Las Vegas sprang to life as a small water stop on the trade routes from Mexico to California. It was not until 1931&#8212;when construction began on the Hoover Dam, thus quadrupling the population in Las Vegas proper&#8212;the true makings of a city would emerge. Recognizing the potential to cash in, Nevada legislators reversed their previously conservative stances, passing a bill to legalize gambling that same year and giving birth to the Vegas we know today.</p>

<p>Here we were, decades later, and Nevada is cashing in again, clearing a cool 3.7 million in revenue during the first month of recreational cannabis sales. This nearly doubles Colorado&#8217;s first month of revenue, while covering a population gap of more than 3.5 million people and an insatiable tourist market.</p>
<p>I woke up early day two, shaking off the previous night&#8217;s festivities in the oversized, cascade-style shower, the endless supply of hot water slowly bringing me back to life. Hailing a cab I arrived at Essence, one of the dozen or so dispensaries now licensed in the area. A small sign split the line into medical and recreational customers and I took my place behind a group of tourists buying legal cannabis for their first time. Smiling, I spotted a few standouts in the display case. Vegas had its share of homegrown cannabis brands, but I was surprised to see some familiar West Coast brands alongside the locals.</p>
<p>For the forward-thinking cannabis entrepreneur, the map was beginning to look a lot like a chess board, and Vegas was beginning to look like the golden goose&#8212;a chance to reach a broader market in an industry wracked with growing pains and stifled by regional restrictions.</p>
<p>Whatever the future would be, the momentum seems unstoppable: Cannabis is here to stay, and (for now) the people who made it possible still have a stake in the game. This was always an industry of believers, and as I took once more for the skies towards Seattle, I was proud to count myself among them.</p>
<p>Next stop, Hawaii&#8230;</p>

TS can be life threatening in patients with severe symptoms, including drug resistant seizures and kidney failure. &#194;&#160;Up to 80 to 90% of individuals with TS will develop epilepsy during their lifetime, with onset typically in childhood. The seizures are often severe, and up to two-thirds of TS patients do not respond adequately to available medical therapies.

<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="17">Tuberous sclerosis, also called tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), is a rare, multi-system genetic disease that causes benign tumors to grow in the brain and on other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, eyes, lungs, and skin. It usually affects the central nervous system and results in a combination of symptoms including seizures, developmental delay, behavioral problems, skin abnormalities, and kidney disease. At the time of designation, tuberous sclerosis affected approximately 1 in 10,000 people in the European Union. This was equivalent to a total of around 52,000 people.* TSC occurs in all races and ethnic groups, and in both genders. The majority of children with TS have onset of seizures during the first year of life, and up to one third of children with TS will develop infantile spasms. Almost all seizure types can be seen in individuals with tuberous sclerosis, including tonic, clonic, tonic-clonic, atonic, myoclonic, atypical absence, partial, and complex partial. The seizures are often severe, and up to two-thirds of TS patients do not respond adequately to available medical therapies. There are significant co-morbidities associated with TS including cognitive impairment, autism spectrum disorders, and neurobehavioral disorders in individuals with TS.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="18">*For the purpose of the designation, the number of patients affected by the condition is estimated and assessed on the basis of data from the European Union (EU 28), Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. This represents a population of 515,700,000 (Eurostat 2017).</p>

					<p>Silicon Valley is no stranger to cannabis culture, so it&#8217;s no surprise that tech companies are driving innovation in the pot world. And guess what? They&#8217;ve got some seriously impressive products.<span id="more-69785"></span></p>
<p>When the state of Colorado passed Amendment 64 in 2012, legalizing recreational marijuana for adults in January of 2014, they opened up a world of possibilities. Legalization created countless new industries in which companies could openly innovate without fear of being shut down for working with an illegal substance.</p>
<p>While the classic joint or pipe will surely never go out of style, there have been some fantastic innovations in the marijuana space over the last few years. From edibles to vapes, cultivation boxes to dab rigs, there are seemingly endless ways to consume cannabis in the growing number of states that have passed legislature legalizing the sticky icky.</p>

			<p>Massachusetts defers recreational marijuana delivery and onsite consumption, Arkansas approves five medical cannabis cultivators, and Washington state grants its floundering hemp program a reprieve.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a closer look at some notable developments in the marijuana industry over the past week.</p>
<p><strong>An &#8216;elegant&#8217; solution</strong></p>
<p>The decision by Massachusetts regulators to <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/massachusetts-will-delay-rollout-marijuana-delivery-onsite-consumption-businesses/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delay licensing</a> for stand-alone marijuana delivery services and onsite consumption businesses drew criticism from some cannabis proponents.</p>
<p>Specifically, critics said the Cannabis Control Commission (CCC) caved under pressure from opponents who wanted a delay.</p>
<p><a href="http://info.mjfreeway.com/opt-in-consulting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-66014" src="https://mjbizdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2.26_MJ_BizAd300x250-01-1.png" alt="" width="300"></a>But at least one advocate for industry diversity applauded the commission&#160;&#8211; especially given the circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a very elegant way for the CCC to meet the demands of a lot of different groups,&#8221; said Shanel Lindsay, a member of the Cannabis Advisory Board, which advises the commission.</p>
<p>Industry diversity advocates like Lindsay view delivery and onsite consumption licenses as a way to bring minorities into the sector because those businesses are less expensive and don&#8217;t necessarily require investor backing.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why such provisions were written into the recreational cannabis referendum that voters passed in 2016.</p>
<p>&#8220;When we were drafting Question 4,&#8221; Lindsay said of the adult-use measure, &#8220;we specifically drafted this law to correct the problem we saw on the medical side. &#8230; There were no small businesses or people of color involved.&#8221;</p>
<p>There was such a clamor from high-ranking state officials and groups like the Commonwealth Dispensary Association to defer delivery and onsite consumption licenses that diversity advocates worried the permits would be delayed indefinitely and unconditionally.</p>
<p>And that would have effectively shut an important door on minority participation in the industry.</p>
<p>But the commission reached a compromise under which it agreed to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draft delivery and onsite consumption rules within one year.</li>
<li>Create an initial time period when those licenses will go only to people affected by the war on drugs.</li>
</ul>
<p>How long should that time period be?</p>
<p>&#8220;We think five years is reasonable,&#8221; Lindsay said. &#8220;The idea is to let these businesses get a foothold in the industry.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Arkansas gets going</strong></p>
<p>The medical marijuana market in Arkansas is gaining momentum after five companies were selected this week to <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/five-companies-picked-grow-medical-cannabis-arkansas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grow cannabis for the program</a>.</p>
<p>David Couch, a Little Rock attorney and MMJ proponent, sees the future success of the program as a matter of timing.</p>
<p>He&#8217;s hoping the Arkansas Medical Mariuana Commission will sync the opening of dispensaries with the growers&#8217; harvest.</p>
<p>Couch is confident the five licensees will have the resources to start building combination greenhouse and warehouse facilities immediately.</p>
<p>The marijuana commission is expected to award 32 dispensary licenses near the end of May.</p>
<p>Couch estimates sales will begin around Labor Day.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s about the soonest you could do it,&#8221; Couch said.&#160;&#8220;The worst thing we could do is open dispensaries and not have enough product.&#8221;</p>
<p>He&#8217;d like to avoid price gouging and a supply shortage, for instance.</p>
<p>Couch noted, however, that dispensaries are permitted to possess 50 mature plants,&#160;&#8220;so they&#8217;re not totally reliant on the growers.&#8221;</p>
<p>There should be plenty of MMJ customers once the dispensaries open.</p>
<p>According to Couch,&#160;the Department of Health has accepted about 5,000 applications from patients.</p>
<p>Registration cards have a one-year expiration date, so they won&#8217;t be issued until 30 days before the dispensaries open.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re trying to do this in a sensible way so when (dispensaries) open, everybody will have their card, everybody will have product and everybody will be happy,&#8221; Couch said.</p>
<p>He expects to see a few more dispensaries and qualifying conditions added once the program is up and running.</p>
<p><strong>A boost for hemp</strong></p>
<p>Washington state&#8217;s endangered hemp program <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/washington-states-fledgling-hemp-program-gets-lifeline-legislators/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came off life support</a>&#160;when state lawmakers proposed restoring money to oversee the fledgling industry.</p>
<p>But hemp advocates in Washington state say there&#8217;s a lot of work ahead to get the program back on track for 2018.</p>
<p>Cory Sharp, a Moses Lake hemp grower who wants to raise 500 acres of hemp this year, is helping plan three free seminars across the state to let farmers and Washington&#8217;s mature marijuana industry know about opportunities in hemp production.</p>
<p>The goal is to alleviate fears that Washington&#8217;s hemp program is going away.</p>
<p>The state had just seven hemp growers in 2017, the first year of Washington&#8217;s program.</p>
<p>&#8220;When they put the brakes on (the hemp program),&#8221; Sharp said, &#8220;it obviously cooled everybody&#8217;s enthusiasm&#8221; for growing the plant.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen a definite chill. Our job now is to re-energize everyone back up.&#8221;</p>
<p>The program&#8217;s future success could hinge on new rules that allow hemp producers to sell flower.</p>
<p>Flower is the most valuable part of the plant, but regulators didn&#8217;t allow it in Washington&#8217;s initial hemp season last year.</p>
<p>The change should spark Washington&#8217;s hemp industry to catch up with its mature marijuana market, Sharp said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We can catch up within a couple years,&#8221; said Sharp, CEO of HempLogic, which also offers hemp seed, processing and consulting services. &#8220;There&#8217;s a ton of interest in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>On Monday, the New Jersey legislature held its first hearing on <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> since Governor Phil Murphy, who supports legalization, replaced the stridently anti-cannabis Chris Christie. It&#8217;s not that lawmakers aren&#8217;t working on bills to legalize marijuana in New Jersey. They are. But they have, so far, failed to bring any proposals to a vote. A bi-partisan consensus, it seems, has been hard to come by. And progress has stalled in large part thanks to civil society groups who&#8217;ve become increasingly vocal in their opposition to legalization. Nevertheless, Monday&#8217;s hearing represents an official start to the effort to legalize marijuana in New Jersey.</p>
<h2>The Effort To Legalize Marijuana In New Jersey Has Officially Begun</h2>
<p>New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy (Dem.) won the governorship on a platform that centered progressive cannabis law reform. So when he assumed office on January 16, many believed legal unconditional cannabis use in New Jersey was a sure thing.</p>
<p>In his first week in office, Murphy <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/governor-new-jersey-ending-prohibition/">signed an executive order</a> to improve access to medical marijuana. The move signaled that Murphy was serious about overhauling the state&#8217;s laws concerning cannabis.</p>
<p>A month into Gov. Murphy&#8217;s term, however, legislative pushback against legalization and other significant reforms began to steer the state toward a compromise position. In mid-February, state senators began <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/new-jersey-favoring-decriminalizing-marijuana-legalization/">calling for decriminalization over legalization</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;This whole legalization stuff needs to slow down. I think folks need to listen to Sen. [Robert] Singer and myself, and people in the community,&#8221; said Sen Ronald Rice, a main sponsor of the compromise decriminalization bill.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>The legislature&#8217;s prevarications gave anti-legalization advocates a chance to amplify their message on the local level. And before lawmakers under Gov. Murphy&#8217;s administration could even propose a vote on a bill, some New Jersey townships had already begun <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/new-jersey-towns-preemptively-banning-cannabis-businesses/">banning cannabis businesses</a>.</p>
<p>It was amidst this atmosphere of sharp divides over legalization that Monday&#8217;s hearing took place. Before a public audience of more than 100 people, and convening more than a dozen experts, lawmakers officially began discussing the <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/new-jersey-marijuana-legalization-include-home-grow/">future of marijuana in New Jersey</a>.</p>
<h2>New Jersey Lawmakers &#8220;Starting With A Blank Slate&#8221;</h2>
<p>Joe Danielsen (Dem.) called <a href="https://www.northjersey.com/story/news/new-jersey/2018/03/05/legal-weed-nj-lawmakers-hold-hearings-amid-questions-over-marijuana-legalization/395055002/" rel="nofollow">Monday&#8217;s hearing</a> citing legalization as an issue &#8220;of great concern to the public&#8221;.</p>
<p>Chairman of the Assembly Oversight, Reform and Federal Relations Committee, Danielsen <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/new_jersey/marijuana-legalize-new-jersey-legislature-20180305.html" rel="nofollow">said</a> the committee would &#8220;start with a blank slate&#8221;.</p>
<p>With positions on cannabis legalization already so entrenched, it might be difficult to start over. But Monday&#8217;s hearing brought in experts on legalization from <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/colorado-release-prisoners-marijuana-convictions/">Colorado</a> and <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/massachusetts-considers-legalizing-cannabis-clubs/">Massachusetts</a>, heard arguments for and against legalization, and took comments from the public.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>At the hearing, topics ranged from <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/bookers-big-fight-federal-pot-legalization-social-justice-reform-on-horizon/">social justice issues</a>, legalization&#8217;s <a href="https://hightimes.com/culture/radical-rant-the-what-about-the-children-anti-marijuana-argument/">impact on children</a>, the problems of the <a href="https://hightimes.com/business/markets-benefit-weed-legalization/">illicit marijuana market</a>, and the future of the state&#8217;s <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/new-jersey-medical-marijuana-program-expansion-on-its-way/">restrictive medical cannabis program</a>.</p>
<p>Sharp differences of opinion emerged, especially around the issues of tax revenue and industry regulation. Still, most of the speakers at Monday&#8217;s hearing expressed support for Gov. Murphy&#8217;s plan.</p>
<h2>Final Hit: Legalizing Marijuana in New Jersey</h2>
<p>No plans or promises for concrete action came out of Monday&#8217;s hearing. It&#8217;s the first of four such hearings Danielsen has scheduled throughout the state through May, kicking off a months-long study of the question of marijuana in New Jersey.</p>
<p>Whether and how the hearings will alter the proposals already in the works remains to be seen. But what counts is that the effort to legalize marijuana in New Jersey has officially begun.</p>
<p>The next hearing of the Assembly oversight committee will be on April 21 at Rowan University, followed by a third at Bergen Community College on May 12.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are aiding and abetting in violations of state cannabis laws,&#8221; states the letter from Lori Ajax, chief of the Bureau of Cannabis Control.</p>
<p>If the company doesn&#8217;t immediately drop advertisements for unlicensed businesses, Ajax said Weedmaps could face criminal and civil penalties, including civil fines for each illegal ad.</p>
<p>The letter is the only one that&#8217;s been sent to an advertising company, according to bureau spokesman Alex Traverso. But it&#8217;s one of more than 900 cease and desist letters his agency has sent to <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/02/20/california-marijuana-growers-licenses/99489/">unlicensed marijuana businesses in California since recreational weed sales were allowed to start</a> and licensing requirements <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/01/california-marijuana-legalization-2018/95667/">kicked in Jan. 1</a>. And Traverso said many of those 900-plus black market shops were discovered on Weedmaps.</p>

<p>Tustin resident Justin Hartfield founded Weedmaps in 2007 with company CEO Doug Francis. The site and its app help visitors find dispensaries and browse their menus, with shops rated much like businesses on Yelp.</p>
<p>Weedmaps has grown into an international juggernaut, with offices from Denver to Berlin. But much of that business has been built on ad revenue from unlicensed dispensaries, with 20 ads for marijuana dispensaries in Anaheim live Wednesday, for example, even though all cannabis businesses are banned in that city.</p>
<p>Weedmaps didn&#8217;t immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. But during a February interview, company president Christopher Beals remained defiant on the issue of accepting ads from black market shops.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing is, at the end of the day, we&#8217;re an information platform,&#8221; Beals said. &#8220;We&#8217;re showing the same information that Google and Yelp and Craigslist and 30 other websites are showing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Beals said he believes it&#8217;s up to states and cities to put in a solid regulatory framework and to permit enough licensed marijuana businesses to meet demand. That&#8217;s the only way to control the illegal market, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;To sort of say, let&#8217;s pretend an illegal market doesn&#8217;t exist or that people can&#8217;t just type &#8216;dispensary&#8217; into Google and find this information, it isn&#8217;t really realistic,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Competing site Leafly.com &#8211; which also maps dispensaries along with ranking strains and offering other cannabis-related information &#8211; announced it was ditching ads from unlicensed shops as of March 1.</p>
<p>&#8220;The California state government has made clear that only licensed retailers and delivery services may advertise via technology platforms,&#8221; stated a Feb. 7 press release announcing the decision.</p>
<p>Leafly, which was also founded in Irvine and is now headquartered in Seattle, said it hopes to pick back up some of the clients it&#8217;s now dropping as the state continues to license more businesses.</p>
<p>Ajax sent Weedmaps the cease and desist letter on Feb. 16. Industry news site Marijuana Business Daily first reported the news Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;As of right now, like with the unlicensed operators, we&#8217;re communicating with Weedmaps,&#8221; Traverso said. &#8220;There is no immediate action planned.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime, it looks like business as usual at Weedmaps.com, with hundreds of dispensaries listed throughout the state even though they&#8217;re only licensed in perhaps 20 percent of California cities.</p>

(<em>AP</em>) &#8212; Pennsylvania&#8217;s budding medical marijuana dispensaries have just about run out of marijuana.</p>
<p>Philly.com reports Friday that high demand has caused the two open dispensaries in the Philadelphia region to go nearly dry less than two weeks after sales started under Pennsylvania&#8217;s new medical marijuana program.</p>
<p>TerraVida Holistic Center in Bucks County says it&#8217;s operating on modified hours and the Keystone shop in Devon has issued a statement saying the store&#8217;s closed until further notice.</p>
<p>The drought is in part due to the fact that only one of the state&#8217;s 12 licensed wholesalers is currently shipping to dispensaries.</p>
<p>More crops are expected to be ready by late March.</p>

    			<p>Investment activity in the cannabis industry has been increasing for several years, but 2018 is on pace to shatter previous records, as global financing in marijuana-related businesses topped $1.4 billion just six weeks into the New Year.</p>
<p><span id="more-86392"></span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.cannabisbenchmarks.com/annual-review-and-outlook-2017-2018-edition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-66014" src="https://mjbizdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1.png" alt="" width="300"></a>According to Viridian Capital Advisors, a New York-based market intelligence firm focused on the cannabis industry, that represents a 580% funding increase compared to the same time in 2017.</p>
<p>If current trends persist, marijuana-related businesses could raise nearly $13 billion by the end of 2018 &#8211; four times more than the <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/global-cannabis-industry-raises-whopping-2-7-billion-2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">approximately $3 billion raised in 2017</a>.</p>
<p>The sharp rise in cannabis industry funding is driven by investor interest in Canadian marijuana businesses.</p>
<p>The country is set to become the first Group of Seven nation to legalize adult-use cannabis this summer.</p>
<p>Legalizing marijuana at the federal level has given deep-pocketed, institutional investors more confidence to inject capital into Canadian-based marijuana companies, resulting in larger, more frequent funding deals.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you need to know about the situation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Of the 42 capital raises that took place over the past three weeks, 30 involved Canadian marijuana businesses. Globally, the number of announced capital raises in 2018 stands at 79, up from 39 at this point last year &#8211; a 103% increase.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Approximately 85% of funding deals in 2018 were in exchange for equity, often by publicly traded companies selling securities. While many companies may prefer to take on debt, financial institutions remain wary of lending money to marijuana businesses.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Over half the capital raised in 2018 has gone to businesses in the cultivation and retail sector. Canada&#8217;s licensed marijuana producers &#8211; which will be the sole providers of recreational marijuana in Canada once adult-use sales begin this summer &#8211; operate in this sector.</li>

<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" style="margin: 0px 0px 1em;" data-reactid="11">United Cannabis Corporation (CNAB) (the &#8221;Company&#8221; or &#8221;United Cannabis&#8221;) today announced that it has initiated extraction services at its Colorado industrial hemp processing plant (the &#8221;Facility&#8221;).</p>
<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="13">The Company established the Facility to provide contract manufacturing to farmers working under the 2014 Federal Farm Bill and Colorado&#8217;s Department of Agriculture&#8217;s Industrial Hemp Program.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="14">The multi-function Facility will provide customers with the ability to create simple extracts, capsules and sublingual drops, as well as process raw hemp seed through cold press extraction. Valuable fibrous bi-products generated through the processing will also be collected for sale to a wide range of consumer product industries. The Company will also offer purification, testing and processing services, as well as packaging, fulfillment, and secure storage capabilities.</p>
<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="15">Earnest Blackmon, Chief Executive Officer of United Cannabis, commented on the announcement, &#8221;We&#8217;re glad to have the processing facility up and running. Colorado farmers account for more than half of U.S. domestic hemp production, but most do not have the resources to process their crop beyond harvest. While demand for CBD and other cannabinoid-centric products continues to grow, the raw plant material remains a commodity product. Our facility provides farmers with a viable outlet to introduce their harvested material into the supply chain, with higher margins for them, which is good news for everyone in the industry.&#8221;</p>

<p>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (<em>AP</em>) &#8212; Illinois voters would be able to say whether they support legalizing recreational marijuana under a proposal lawmakers have approved.</p>
<p>Senators voted 37-13 Thursday to put a non-binding question on the November ballot. Chicago Democratic Sen. Bill Cunningham is the sponsor. He says the referendum question will act as a statewide opinion poll.</p>
<p>The proposal now goes to the House for vote. To make it to the ballot, it needs Gov. Bruce Rauner&#8217;s signature. The governor calls the effort misguided and legalization a mistake.</p>
<p>Sen. Heather Steans and Rep. Kelly Cassidy introduced legislation to legalize recreational marijuana last year. The Chicago Democrats previously said they do not expect the measure to be debated this session.</p>
<h2>Former congressional aide convicted of taking pot shop bribe</h2>
<p>LOS ANGELES (<em>AP</em>) &#8212; A former California congressional aide has been convicted of taking a $5,000 bribe from an illegal marijuana shop he threatened to shut down.</p>
<p>City News Service says Michael Kimbrew was found guilty Thursday of attempted extortion and receiving a bribe.</p>
<p>He faces up to 18 years in prison when he&#8217;s sentenced June 4.</p>
<p>Prosecutors say Kimbrew solicited the bribe from a pot shop in Compton.</p>
<p>The indictment said Kimbrew claimed he was working with the FBI and could help the shop get permits to stay open if the owners paid him.</p>

					<p>CANNABIS CULTURE &#8211;&#160;On January 21 2018, Jake Honig passed away peacefully in his bed at the age of seven. His life and his legacy further exposed his home state of New Jersey to the miraculous medical potential of cannabis, And his death forever changed the laws, and the public perception of cannabis.<span id="more-69814"></span></p>
<p>Jake&#8217;s parents, Mike and Janet, openly shared the great impact cannabis had on Jake&#8217;s illness and quality of life. They were also vocal on what could still be improved with medical cannabis in New Jersey. Their call was heard by New Jersey lawmakers including Governor Phil Murphy. Just two days after Jake&#8217;s passing, Mike, Janet, and six-year-old Gianna gathered in the Governor&#8217;s office as he signed an executive order requiring the Department of Health to reopen the conversation of New Jersey&#8217;s medical cannabis regulations. As Jake&#8217;s story picked up more momentum, catching the attention of local news outlets, outside media, and families, the Honigs opened the dialogue even further.</p>
<p>Jake Honig&#8217;s Law was introduced in February 2018. If approved, the bill will lift the two ounce restriction, allow a patient&#8217;s doctor to prescribe an unlimited amount of medical marijuana, and would mean that dispensaries could sell medical cannabis in forms other than flower for easier and safer administration. Jake Honig&#8217;s Law would mean that anyone with illness and disease could be able to live out their lives comfortably, with dignity and pain at ease, as Jake did.<img class=" wp-image-69839 alignleft" src="https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/39977-350x350.jpeg" alt="" width="402" height="402" srcset="https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/39977-350x350.jpeg 350w, https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/39977-150x150.jpeg 150w, https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/39977-350x350@2x.jpeg 700w, https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/39977-150x150@2x.jpeg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 402px) 100vw, 402px"></p>
<p>Jake&#8217;s memory not only lives on in his loved ones&#8217; hearts but in this movement. His and his family&#8217;s bravery and persistence is exposing the difference that cannabis can make. The Honigs also plan on becoming majorly involved with the state&#8217;s program by assisting in campaigns that will encompass all aspects of patients receiving the treatments they deserve.</p>
<p>Jake Honig, along with his family, are among those who have made and continue to make radical impacts in their home community of Howell, New Jersey, as well as the whole state.</p>
<p>Diagnosed with brain cancer at the age of two, Jake Honig, along with his parents Janet and Mike, and sister Gianna embarked on a rigorous journey that would inspire change in their own lives and their community&#8217;s, as well as New Jersey&#8217;s medical marijuana industry on a legislative level. In a state where the legal limit of purchasing medical marijuana is just two ounces every 30 days, Jake, Mike, Janet, and Gianna experienced first hand the issue with these regulations. Their story ignited a fight to implement change and greater comfort to the sick who are in need of medical cannabis. That journey&#8212; Jake&#8217;s journey&#8212; consists of perseverance and heartache but has also changed the way medical marijuana is perceived, handled, and distributed statewide. In order to tell of how one young boy used his battle with cancer to help others benefit from medical marijuana, his story will have to rewind a few years.</p>
<p>After receiving the diagnosis of a brain tumor with a rare genetic disorder in 2012, Jake received treatment at the Children&#8217;s Hospital of Philadelphia. There, at the young age of two, Jake&#8217;s inspiring strength shined during and after his extensive surgery to remove the tumor from his brain&#8212; granting him the nickname Jake &#8220;the Tank.&#8221; The year following Jake&#8217;s surgery, a staggering 14 rounds of chemotherapy and 28 rounds a radiation would be pumped through his body in the attempt to rid any lingering cancer.</p>
<p>This treatment left Jake with high fevers, agonizing mouth sores, vomiting, to only name a few. Yet even during all the pain and hurt, Jake &#8220;The Tank&#8221; somehow managed to keep a smile on his face and his spirits high. And after a year of trips to the hospital and rounds of toxic medication Jake&#8217;s brain cancer went into remission.</p>
<p>For three and a half years Jake remained cancer free. With buoyant gumption, Jake and his family made up for the year they had just spent in treatment by taking memorable Honig family trips and spending as much time together as a family as possible; even getting to meet Golden State Warriors super star player Steph Curry. It was a paramount time for the Honigs&#8212; showing gratitude that Jake had beat his cancer as well as remaining conscious of the cancer&#8217;s possible returning at any moment.<img class=" wp-image-69840 alignright" src="https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/21506-197x350.jpeg" alt="" width="356" height="632" srcset="https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/21506-197x350.jpeg 197w, https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/21506-197x350@2x.jpeg 394w" sizes="(max-width: 356px) 100vw, 356px"></p>
<p>In between family trips and making memories over Jake&#8217;s remission, the Honigs would attend routine appointments for Jake to be checked for any returning cancer. On his 4-year MRI scan in April 2017, it was discovered that the cancer had returned. And just like that, the Honigs and the doctors at the Children&#8217;s Hospital of Philadelphia jumped back into action as they had four years before.</p>
<p>As the battle of Jake&#8217;s brain cancer ensued, Jake &#8220;The Tank&#8217;s&#8221; fortitude returned as well. At just six years old, Jake Honig walked himself into his own operating room just before his second brain surgery, telling his doctor to &#8220;make me good again,&#8221; something virtually unheard of for someone with Jake&#8217;s illness. That summer Jake would receive more extensive and debilitating rounds of chemotherapy and radiation. Unfortunately, during Jake&#8217;s first routine MRI scan in November 2017, it was discovered that his brain tumor had returned despite his treatments and now had multiple tumors spread over his brain.</p>
<p>This left the Honigs with the option of one more round of chemo for Jake to slow the cancer&#8217;s progression. November was also when the Honigs decided to incorporate medical marijuana into Jake&#8217;s routine. The medication proved first-rate in providing comfort and easing Jake&#8217;s pain almost instantly. The family spent the following month at home with each other before pains in Jake&#8217;s stomach brought them back for another MRI. The scan revealed Jake&#8217;s cancer had spread down his spine.</p>
<p>With the discovering of tumors spread over his brain, spine, and lower back, Jake&#8217;s doctors had no choice but to deliver the dire news to his family that Jake was terminal. Mike and Janet came to decide that their son&#8217;s remaining time would be best spent at home, under the care of hospice and kept as comfortable as possible until he passed away.</p>
<p>During Jake&#8217;s time at home, treating his pain with medical cannabis became the family&#8217;s choice of medication. Being sent home with six different medications, the side effects and lack of easing Jake&#8217;s pain brought Janet and Mike to take Jake off them completely. The amount of comfort medical marijuana brought Jake was palpable; being able to stand, eat, sleep, and gave back Jake &#8220;the Tank&#8217;s&#8221; smile and golden attitude. However, this brought on a new set of tribulations for the family.</p>
<p>As New Jersey law states, those prescribed medical marijuana and their caregivers cannot purchase over two ounces of cannabis every 30 days nor is it possible to by any kind of oil, tincture, or topicals. This meant that Janet and Mike, neither of them medical marijuana professionals, would have to convert their medical flower into oil form in their own kitchen every night before distributing it to Jake. As his illness spread, Jake would ingest all of the two ounces well before their 30 day period was up.</p>
<p>Mike and Janet were also left to their own devices of determining the right type of strain of flower to buy, Jake&#8217;s needed dosage, the best way of administrating&#8212; all without any type of provided training or information by the state. Every two weeks Jake would need more medicine, his two ounces depleted. In an attempt to make the medical marijuana spread further, it was often incorporated with morphine. This heavy drug proved to be futile in Jake&#8217;s pain levels and would always opt for the cannabis over morphine. Although it was understood that Jake&#8217;s medication wouldn&#8217;t be living saving, time and time again cannabis would improve his daily life and ultimately gave the Honigs as much &#8220;normal&#8221; family time as possible during Jake&#8217;s final days.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p>Along with his trailblazing fight, Jake lives on through the rest of his contributions. He donated his brain and spine to the Children&#8217;s Hospital of Philadelphia and thousands of dollars have been donated to different medical nonprofits and research facilities by those touched by his story. Through his sickness, Jake&#8217;s strength and optimism granted him an honorary Howell Police Officer. All 84 Howell police officers attended his funeral and two day viewing with honor guard watching over his casket.</p>
<p>Jake&#8217;s inspiring story has ignited a fire of life-altering change, showing that everyone deserves a quality life. Even in death, Jake lives on through his contributions and in those Jake Honig&#8217;s Law will surely help. Jake&#8217;s legacy can be followed through the hashtag #BeLikeJake and <a href="http://facebook.com/JakeHonig1">Facebook.com/JakeHonig1</a></p>

					<p>For 60 years, Brigitte Biesel struggled with chronic pain and depression &#8212;until her grandson introduced her to edibles.<span id="more-69849"></span></p>
<p>Most people Brigitte Biesel&#8217;s age use their mini scales to weigh letters, but the 80-year-old bought hers to measure weed. &#8220;Recently, I saw one similar to mine on Bares f&#252;r Rares [the German equivalent of Antiques Roadshow],&#8221; she tells me excitedly. As she&#8217;s chatting, she&#8217;s also trying to concentrate on grinding the cannabis buds onto her delicate silver scale.</p>
<p>Today is baking day at Brigitte&#8217;s terraced house in K&#246;penick, Germany, a picturesque district in Berlin. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s safe to say that I&#8217;m the first person to bake this specific variety of cookies here,&#8221; she laughs.</p>

<p>Lumberton mayor Quincy Rogers told WDAM-TV that Shane Flynt was sent home Tuesday. The mayor says Flynt will remain on suspension until after the city&#8217;s board of aldermen meet.</p>
<p>The next board meeting is scheduled for March 6.</p>

<p>Flynt said he made a &#8220;huge mistake&#8221; in a statement on Facebook. He says his wife filmed him while inside his home. </p>
<p>In the video, Flynt laughed about being police chief using vulgar language and a broken pipe. His chief uniform can be seen hanging in the background while Christmas music plays. It&#8217;s not clear when the video was recorded.</p>
<p>Board members also suspended Flynt earlier in February but later allowed him to come back.</p>

<p>SOME OF THE BEST PEOPLE SMOKE POT</p>
<p>JON RUDDY</p>
<p>THE INTERVIEWS THAT follow may shock you or touch you or make you mad or make you laugh. They will make you think. We have all heard that marijuana, once the &#8220;noxious,&#8221; &#8220;crippling&#8221; and &#8220;degrading&#8221; preserve of criminals, jazz musicians, delinquents and, latterly, hippies, has shown a tremendous upward mobility in the last few years. This is true. It&#8217;s no pipe dream &#8212; it&#8217;s here. The virtues and dangers of marijuana are debatable but its wide acceptance is obvious. Many of my acquaintances, in the silly lexicon of this underground revolution, &#8220;turn on&#8221; and profess to believe that doing so is harmless as well as wonderfully pleasant. I don&#8217;t know any criminals, jazz musicians, delinquents or hippies. I do know a lawyer who says, &#8220;Half the law students in the country smoke pot. It is just a matter of time until our legal institutions are comprised mainly of pot-heads. Do you think it will be illegal then?&#8221;</p>

					<p>&#8216;One of the most striking things is how normal it is,&#8217; says Colorado marijuana media mogul.<span id="more-69864"></span></p>
<p>Legal cannabis has changed a few things in Denver, but for the marijuana media mogul who covers the scene in Colorado, it&#8217;s what hasn&#8217;t changed that&#8217;s most noticeable.</p>
<p>&#8220;One of the most striking things is how normal it is,&#8221; said Cassandra Farrington, in an interview Friday on The Homestretch.</p>
<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t really tell a difference of pre-[recreational]and post-recreational cannabis,&#8221; she said. &#8220;You drive past a dispensary [and]it&#8217;s like driving past a liquor store.</p>

					<p>When Shanel Lindsay graduated from Northeastern University law school in 2007, she never imagined she would draw on her J.D. as an advocate in the world of legalized marijuana<span id="more-69836"></span>. But her degree has proven powerful: she has emerged as one of the leading voices for social justice in the space, especially in Massachusetts, where she grew up.</p>
<p>As the state prepares for the launch of recreational marijuana sales on July 1st, Lindsay, who was raised in Boston, has been fighting on behalf of communities hit hard by the War on Drugs to ensure they don&#8217;t lose out on the economic opportunity of this new market.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is about making sure we are improving the city that I love and the place where many of my family members still live and many black people live,&#8221; explains Lindsay, who was appointed last year to the state&#8217;s Cannabis Policy Advisory Board, &#8220;Our communities are the ones that have been decimated and destroyed by this over-enforcement [of drug laws]and our family members and kids are being affected by this.&#8221;</p>
