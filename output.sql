<p>Kaden Hartman of Virginia Beach is 13-years-old and lives with <a href="https://nnpdf.org/overview/" rel="nofollow">Niemann-Pick disease</a>, a condition known colloquially as Child&#8217;s Alzheimer&#8217;s. There are approximately 500 to 100 cases of diagnosed NPD today, making it extremely rare. Children with Niemann-Pick disease experience rapid physical and mental deterioration. Eventually, they&#8217;re faced with seizures and problems with mobility, eating, and communication. According to the <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/OnCall/story?id=4760023" rel="nofollow">National Niemann-Pick Disease Foundation</a>, most children suffering from Child&#8217;s Alzheimer&#8217;s don&#8217;t live to age 20. Kathy Hartman, the mother of this 13-year-old denied life-saving treatment because he used <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/cannabidiol-cbd/">CBD</a> oil, reached out to <em>High Times</em> to explain what happened.</p>
<h2>Kaden&#8217;s FDA-Approved Treatment</h2>
<p>&#8220;When there&#8217;s nothing else out there to save his life, the FDA will approve an experimental medicine, and he&#8217;s been on it for almost three years,&#8221; Mrs. Hartman explains.</p>
<p>The drug the FDA approved for Kaden is called Cyclodextrin and has been effectively treating Kaden&#8217;s Niemann-Pick disease.</p>
<p>Doctors predicted that Kaden wouldn&#8217;t live to age 13, but he&#8217;ll be 14 in April.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s definitely working,&#8221; says Mrs. Hartman.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>The Benefits of CBD Oil</h2>
<div id="attachment_182272" style="max-width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-182272" src="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-1.jpeg" alt="13-Year-Old Denied Life-Saving Treatment Because He Used CBD Oil" width="1000" height="1294" srcset="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-1.jpeg 1000w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-1-77x100.jpeg 77w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-1-185x240.jpeg 185w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-1-768x994.jpeg 768w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-1-742x960.jpeg 742w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><p class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fa fa-camera"></i> Courtesy of Kathy Hartman</p></div>
<p>In addition to the experimental Cyclodextrin, Kaden has been taking CBD oil since he started experiencing <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/2-year-old-celebrates-seizure-free-using-hemp-oil/">seizures</a>, a common consequence of Niemann-Pick disease.</p>
<p>&#8220;It slows down seizures by, I think, 60 percent,&#8221; Mrs. Hartman says of CBD after doing research on the non-psychoactive compound of <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> on her own.</p>
<p>Watching her son experience 10 to 20 seizures daily, Mrs. Hartman decided to give CBD a shot, under the supervision of Kaden&#8217;s primary neurologist.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems to be working great,&#8221; Mrs. Hartman told Kaden&#8217;s neurologist who closely monitored his CBD use.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">

		</div>

<p>With CBD, Kaden avoided the negative side-effects associated with anti-seizure medication.</p>
<p>According to Kaden&#8217;s mother, the only potential results of CBD use are slight drowsiness and a better appetite.</p>
<p>Going off CBD, however, has had serious consequences.</p>
<p>After Mrs. Hartman received a letter from the Virginia Commonwealth University Medical Center (VCU), the hospital treating Kaden, stating that Kaden will be taken off the study if he uses CBD, she stopped giving him the herbal supplements.</p>
<p>Off CBD, Kaden experiences many seizures. He has since fractured his skull, concussed himself, and developed two blood clots in his brain.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>Not only was this 13-year-old denied life-saving treatment because he used CBD oil, but CBD oil itself was a lifesaving treatment for seizures.</p>
<h2>Neurologists who work with&#160;Niemann-Pick disease patients recommend CBD Oil</h2>
<p>In addition to Kaden&#8217;s personal experience with CBD&#8217;s benefits, two of his neurologists recommended it.</p>
<p>His primary neurologist of 8 years suggested that Kaden take CBD to cope with his seizures.</p>
<p>Dr. Ralph Northam, Kaden&#8217;s former pediatrician who is now the governor of Virginia, wrote Kaden a prescription for cannabidiol.</p>
<p>Though Mrs. Hartman didn&#8217;t fill out this prescription at the time, it allowed Kaden access to CBD much more potent than the health store variety he later took.</p>
<p>Dr. Rebecca Caffrey, a friend of the Hartman family, explains, &#8220;CBD is the drug of choice for treating seizures in NPC kids.&#8221;</p>
<p>She cites another case of two young girls who suffer from Niemann-Pick disease and began taking CBD oil to minimize their seizures.</p>
<p>Not only did CBD help these girls&#8212;the daughters of Kathy Hartman&#8217;s friend Chris Hempel&#8212;but they are allowed to continue their other treatment, which is of the same nature as Kaden&#8217;s.</p>
<h2>Why the Hospital stopped Kaden&#8217;s Treatment</h2>
<div id="attachment_182273" style="max-width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-182273" src="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-2.jpeg" alt="13-Year-Old Denied Life-Saving Treatment Because He Used CBD Oil" width="1000" height="666" srcset="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-2.jpeg 1000w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-2-100x67.jpeg 100w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-2-360x240.jpeg 360w, https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/denied-life-saving-treatment-used-cbd-oil-2-768x511.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><p class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fa fa-camera"></i> Courtesy of Kathy Hartman</p></div>
<p>Four days after sending Mrs. Hartman that threatening letter, VCU gave her a call.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your son is on CBD oil. He is terminated from the clinical trial. Don&#8217;t bother ever showing up again,&#8221; Mrs. Hartman says, summing up her conversation.</p>
<p>Confused and infuriated, Mrs. Hartman reached out to VCU repeatedly, to no avail. However, Mrs. Hartman and Kaden showed up to his next appointments.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think they tried to trick me,&#8221; Mrs. Hartman explains. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want to break protocol with the FDA because now that would give them reason to terminate. So, I showed up for those [other appointments].&#8221;</p>
<p>Though Kaden attended his first two appointments after his trial was terminated, VCU canceled his critical spinal tap appointment held every other Monday.</p>
<p>To date, VCU has amended their statement, though this 13-year-old denied life-saving treatment because he used CBD Oil still cannot access Cyclodextrin.</p>
<p>VCU told Mrs. Hartman that they can get Kaden back on treatment once they have approval from the FDA, the International Review Board (IRB), and the pharmaceutical company.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartman says that they don&#8217;t need any of these approvals due to the nature of Kaden&#8217;s treatment and that they shouldn&#8217;t be sharing information with the pharmaceutical company in the first place.</p>
<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;re giving his data to the pharmaceutical company without me agreeing to it, they have a major malpractice suit,&#8221; Mrs. Hartman clarifies.</p>
<p>But most importantly, the process of gaining all these unnecessary approvals could take months.</p>
<p>&#8220;The FDA only meets once a month. The IRB only meets maybe quarterly or once a month,&#8221; Mrs. Hartman worries.</p>
<p>To make matters more difficult, the company that manufactures Cyclodextrin has been bought out twice.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartman worries that &#8220;[Kaden] might never ever get back on this study.&#8221;</p>
<p>This could mean that this 13-year-old denied life-saving treatment because he used CBD oil may never again receive the medical care he needs.</p>
<h2>CBD doesn&#8217;t require FDA approval</h2>
<p>Not only do Kaden and others with NPD benefit from CBD, and experts recommend it across the board, but Kaden&#8217;s clinical trial never forbade CBD.</p>
<p>The FDA categorizes Kaden&#8217;s treatment as an IND: Individual New Drug Investigation.</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s not part of a formal clinical trial. He&#8217;s a single patient under the compassionate use law,&#8221; Mrs. Hartman explains.</p>
<p>This means that Kaden&#8217;s treatment is more informal, and they don&#8217;t have to get FDA approval for CBD use.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Caffrey, &#8220;[Kaden] has received many meds not on the protocol, like steroids for the swelling in his fractured skull and pain meds during his recovery from that injury.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not only did doctors give Kaden medication without going through the FDA, but other patients with the same compassionate care drug trials for Niemann-Pick disease routinely take CBD.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartman believes, &#8220;All they have to do is write a two-paragraph letter to the FDA saying FYI we put him on this medicine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Kaden&#8217;s doctor never even attempted to do so.</p>
<h2>Final Hit: 13-year-old denied life-saving treatment because he used CBD Oil</h2>
<p>The story of a 13-year-old denied life-saving treatment because he used CBD oil is tragic, unethical and, most likely, illegal.</p>
<p>Every moment that medical professional withholds the only treatment for Niemann-Pick disease, they are endangering Kaden&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>&#8220;First do no harm. By doing nothing, you&#8217;re creating harm,&#8221; as Mrs. Hartman told Dr. Syndi Seinfeld&#160;of VCU, who is responsible for halting Kaden&#8217;s treatment.</p>
<p>Mrs. Hartman looks to the case of her friend Shanon&#8217;s son who missed two doses of cyclodextrin and died as a result.</p>
<p>Kaden missed his first dose on January 26<sup>th</sup> and has missed more since.</p>
<p>Confronted with the injustice of a medical community beholden to pharmaceutical companies and the ignorance of medical professionals, Mrs. Hartman told VCU, &#8220;You take him off the study&#8230;you just killed my child.&#8221;</p>

<p>Kentucky checks all the boxes for nourishing a hemp revival.</p>
<ul>
<li>Climate suited to the plant? Check.</li>
<li>Friendly regulations from a state willing to experiment and invest in hemp? Check.</li>
<li>Lots of cheap land and a processing infrastructure that includes in-state decortication and CBD extractors? Check and check.</li>
</ul>
<p>So why do some agronomists fear that Kentucky has reached its hemp zenith?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cannabisbenchmarks.com/annual-review-and-outlook-2017-2018-edition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-66014" src="https://mjbizdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1.png" alt="" width="300"></a>It&#8217;s a matter of how big the hemp market is going to get.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of reached a peak,&#8221; said David Williams, a plant and soil scientist at the University of Kentucky, which owns several hemp plots and has done more research than any other U.S. university to study the crop&#8217;s revival.</p>
<p>&#8220;It seems that hemp production in Kentucky has about met demand from the processing infrastructure.&#8221;</p>
<p>Williams was even more negative last November when he addressed a national gathering of entomologists meeting in Denver.</p>
<p>Talking about hemp&#8217;s global market potential, Williams said, &#8220;it&#8217;s not even a grain of sand on the beach of agriculture.&#8221;</p>
<p>A tough analysis, for sure.</p>
<p>Indeed, Kentucky&#8217;s approved total acreage for hemp in 2018 is down slightly from 2017, from 12,800 acres to 12,018 acres.</p>
<p>And though Kentucky authorized 12,800 acres for hemp last year, only about 3,200 acres of hemp were planted.</p>
<p>Kentucky still boasts the nation&#8217;s second-largest hemp industry, threatening Colorado&#8217;s market dominance and teasing a shift in the hemp sector away from Western states to former tobacco-growing areas.</p>
<p>Can the growth continue? Kentucky hemp insiders aren&#8217;t sure.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re at an inflection point, and we need to determine how hard we&#8217;re going to lean in,&#8221; said Chad Rosen, CEO of Victory Hemp Foods and president of the Kentucky Hemp Industries Association.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s what you need to know about Kentucky&#8217;s hemp market.</p>
<p><strong>Industry snapshot&#160;</strong></p>
<p>Kentucky saw hemp&#8217;s promise as quickly as any state, seizing on the plant as a potential replacement for tobacco, once grown in abundance across the Bluegrass State.</p>
<p>&#8220;If there are two sweet spots in the world to grow hemp, it&#8217;s China and Kentucky,&#8221; said Brian Furnish, president of global production at Ananda Hemp, whose holdings include 600 acres in Cynthiana, Kentucky.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have the latitude. The climate. The soil type. Kentucky is made for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>In fact, Kentucky&#8217;s two Republican U.S. Senators, Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell, were instrumental in opening the door for the modern-day U.S. hemp industry.</p>
<p>The Kentuckians steered hemp into the <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/farm-bill-could-pave-the-way-for-billion-dollar-hemp-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2014 Farm Bill</a> and have remained fierce industry advocates even as critics in their own party bemoaned hemp as a gateway to marijuana.</p>
<p>Kentucky authorized hemp production in 2013, a year before the federal government did, and is thought to be the only state using Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement funds to support a hemp industry.</p>
<p>Kentucky has collected more than $2 billion from the tobacco settlement since it was struck in 1998. Half the money goes to the Governor&#8217;s Office of Agriculture Policy, which promotes crops including hemp.</p>
<p>As of 2017, Kentucky had:</p>
<ul>
<li>209 licensed hemp growers</li>
<li>12,800 outdoor acres licensed for cultivation</li>
<li>43 licensed processors</li>
</ul>
<p>Kentucky allows hemp production for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flower</li>
<li>Seed or seed oil</li>
<li>Fiber</li>
</ul>
<p>Some hemp producers in Kentucky say their state&#8217;s embrace of the industry comes not in spite of its resistance to marijuana, but because of it.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no confusion here. We&#8217;re a hemp-first state. We don&#8217;t get clouded with marijuana,&#8221; said Michael Joseph French, president of AgTech Scientific, a Kentucky hemp company working on a new $5 million hemp-processing plant in the town of Paris.</p>
<p><strong>Market considerations</strong></p>
<p>Kentucky&#8217;s hemp growers are facing the same price pressure seen in other mature cannabis markets &#8211; the days of sky-high prices are over.</p>
<p>Though no formal commodity pricing exists in the hemp market, Kentucky growers surveyed by <em>Marijuana Business Daily</em> report that growers are getting:</p>
<ul>
<li>About $20-$50 per pound of dried flower, depending on CBD content and quality.</li>
<li>About 70-85 cents per pound of seed for pressing into oil.</li>
<li>No reliable price for fiber, because the market is so small.</li>
</ul>
<p>Kentucky&#8217;s future as a hemp-market leader depends on whether the state continues to plow money into promoting the new crop, Rosen said.</p>
<p>&#8220;They say, &#8216;Settlers get the arrows,&#8217; and that definitely happened here, getting hemp off the ground and making mistakes,&#8221; he added.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have a clear opportunity to maintain our dominance as a hemp state, but this is where fatigue sets in.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rosen&#8217;s company is closing on a deal to start processing hemp in Vermont, but he sees ongoing potential in Kentucky if the state keeps putting money toward the industry.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have incredible infrastructure available to the hemp industry,&#8221; Rosen said, &#8220;and there&#8217;s a low cost of doing business in Kentucky.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now is when we&#8217;ll see if Kentucky keeps going.&#8221;</p>

Endexx, with its collaborative partners and consultants, develops and distributes two consumable product lines derived from industrial hemp, which is organic and naturally rich in phytocannabinoids. Phyto-Bites&#194;&#174;, is its CBD-infused soft chews for dogs. The dog treats are formulated to promote health and support the reduction of separation anxiety, pain and inflammation. The company also has two technology products and services that launched in 2014 &#8212; the M3hub and the Autospense&#226;&#132;&#162;. Both products provide essential solutions to promote regulatory compliance and full accountability through &#8220;seed to sale&#8221; inventory management and an &#8220;End of Sale&#8221; technology integration. Based on principles developed by the pharmacological industry, the m3hub platform is the first standardized software solution for tracking pharmaceutical grade marijuana that maintains compliance with federal, state and local regulations. It is intended to provide a smooth transition to eventual federal mandates. The Autospense&#226;&#132;&#162; is a commercial grade inventory control and dispensing device that provides up-to-the-minute accounting details and ensures both product and patient security.

It leads to significant scratching and, in severe cases, results in excoriations and prurigo nodularis. Although the pathophysiology is not well understood, it is likely multi-factorial, involving immune system dysregulation (including elevated pro-inflammatory activity) and imbalance in the endogenous opioid system.<sup>1</sup>&#194;&#160;Based on annual prescriptions written for the symptomatic treatment of CLD-aP across liver conditions, it is estimated that approximately 2.5 million patients in the United States, or 30-40 percent of patients with CLD, suffer from CLD-aP.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>Lawmakers in the Bluegrass State are currently considering a medicinal <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> bill. With it, Kentucky could allow medical marijuana for these conditions.</p>
<p>Legislators from both major parties are working together to pass a medical marijuana law this year. House Bill 166 (HB-166), if passed, would permit patients with serious health conditions to use cannabis therapies.</p>
<p>Members of the House Judiciary Committee are deliberating the bill this week.</p>
<p>Rep. John Sims Jr., a Democrat from Fleming, is the sponsor of the bill. The current measure does not contain a specific list of conditions that would qualify a patient for the program.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>But Jaime Montalvo, of activist group Kentuckians for Medicinal Marijuana, <a href="https://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/politics/2018/03/07/medical-marijuana-kentucky-ailments/390873002/" rel="nofollow">told the press</a> that a substitute draft of the bill has been written.</p>
<p>Rep. Sims said the new version of HB-166 is pending introduction.</p>
<h2>Conditions Under Consideration, A to Z</h2>
<p>Lawmakers are considering the following conditions for inclusion in Kentucky&#8217;s medical marijuana program.</p>
<ul class="">
<li class=""><a href="https://hightimes.com/health/marijuana-help-hiv-patients-maintain-mental-stamina/">AIDS (Acquired immune deficiency syndrome)</a></li>

<li class="">Terminal illness</li>
<li class="">Traumatic brain injury</li>
<li class="">Wasting syndrome</li>
</ul>
<h2>Strict Rules for MMJ</h2>
<p>Kentucky&#8217;s medical marijuana program will be strictly regulated under HB-166. Patients with one of the approved conditions would need a recommendation from a physician.</p>
<p>They would have to obtain a required identification card from the state, as well.</p>
<p>Rules will also limit how much medicine a patient could possess at one time.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Doctors would also be required to obtain state approval to issue recommendations to patients.</p>
<h2>Necessary Medicine</h2>
<p>Cannabis advocate Montalvo addressed the judiciary committee on Monday, <a href="https://www.wcpo.com/news/state/state-kentucky/kentucky-lawmakers-begin-review-of-medical-marijuana-bill" rel="nofollow">according to reports</a>. He told lawmakers that there is a legitimate need for medical marijuana in Kentucky.</p>
<p>&#8220;House Bill 166 is not about a party,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not about having fun. This is about sick patients, qualifying patients, having safe access to a plant created by our Creator.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rep. Sims then urged his colleagues on the committee to approve the measure. He noted that sick people were relying on them to act.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is about patients who have exhausted all their options and resources and now are begging us to pull our heads from the sand to help,&#8221; Sims said.</p>
<h2>Law Enforcement Opposition</h2>
<p>As can be expected, law enforcement in the state does not support HB-166.</p>
<p>Keith Cain, the Daviess County Sheriff, testified before the House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, according to a <a href="https://www.wcpo.com/news/state/state-kentucky/kentucky-medical-marijuana-bill-runs-into-law-enforcement-opposition" rel="nofollow">report in local media</a>.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentC -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc article_middleContentC dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>He urged the body not approve the bill, while seemingly acknowledging its usefulness.</p>
<p>&#8220;My opposition to this legislation isn&#8217;t because I lack compassion for the sick, but because I think it&#8217;s wrong to herald marijuana &#8212; with its many proven negative qualities,&#8221; said Sheriff Cain.</p>
<p>Chris Cohron, a prosecutor from Warren County, also warned against passage of HB-166.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a road we do not want to go down,&#8221; he said ominously.</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;Kentucky Could Allow Medical Marijuana For These Conditions</h2>
<p>A vote by the judiciary committee to send the measure to the full House for deliberation could happen as soon as today. Rep. Sims is optimistic about the outcome.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re close on the votes,&#8221; he told reporters.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/postal-workers-convicted-in-scheme-to-ship-pot-through-the-mail-476098713.html" rel="nofollow">NBC Chicago</a>, the black market cannabis shipping operation originally took place in 2016 and spanned over the course of five months.</p>
<p>51-year-old Marvin Jones and 44-year-old Angela Wansley, two U.S. Postal Service workers, would regularly intercept packages&#160;containing cannabis and several other unnamed drugs mailed by associate Jayson Smith, a co-defendant in the case.</p>
<p>According to prosecutors, Jones would tip off Smith about unused P.O. boxes and customers who placed mail-hold requests at the post office.</p>
<p>In turn, Smith would mail the drug packages to said locations, while tipping off Jones with mail-tracking information, to ensure Jones or Wansley could intercept the packages before they would get delivered.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

			</div>
		</div>

<p class="paragraph">Jones and Wansley would accept cash payments from Smith, or sometimes Courtney Poindexter, another defendant, in exchange for the packages.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Following an extensive four-day-trial, Jones and Wansley were convicted of accepting bribes to perform official postal duties, conspiring to commit obstruction of correspondence and obstruction of correspondence.</p>
<p class="paragraph">&#160;If ultimately found guilty, the duo can face up to 15 years in prison for the bribery charge alone.</p>
<p class="paragraph">Additionally, the obstruction of correspondence and conspiracy to commit an obstruction of correspondence&#160;charges can result in an additional ten years of prison time, combined.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>Final Hit:&#160;Post Office Employees Busted For Shipping Weed</h2>
<p>Despite the plant being legal, to some degree, in 29 states and the District of Columbia, shipping marijuana can lead to a world of unnecessary trouble.</p>
<p>Even shipping within the confines of a&#160;weed-legal state could result in drug trafficking charges by the federal government.</p>
<p>Since cannabis still remains <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/attorneys-argue-pots-schedule-i-listing-is-a-civil-rights-violation/">a highly illegal substance in the fed&#8217;s eye</a>, it can result in a lengthy, and frankly, <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/77-year-old-missouri-man-growing-weed/">unfair prison sentence</a>.</p>
<p>And considering both Jones and Wansley were, by definition, government&#160;employees under the U.S. Postal Service, their&#160;scheme could be seen as a somewhat treasonous act by governing officials, and met with stringent and swift punishment.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear at the time what the other illicit substances in question were, but for pot alone, the notion of facing up to 25 years in prison is a ludicrous one.</p>
<p>Currently, there are no set dates for the sentencing hearings. Our guess is that the duo would rather know their fates sooner, rather than later.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>The saga of <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/massachusetts-lawmakers-to-restart-talks-on-compromise-marijuana-bill/">legal weed in Massachusetts</a> continues dragging on. But this week, after lawmakers agreed on a basic regulatory framework, we&#8217;re seeing <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a> retail sales in Massachusetts closer than ever.</p>
<h2>Approving Weed Regulations</h2>
<p>Yesterday, the state&#8217;s Cannabis Control Commission (CCC) reached what could be a key milestone. After many months of <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/legalization/everything-need-know-future-pot-massachusetts/">tedious debates and back and forth deliberation</a>, the commission finally approved its final set of regulations.</p>
<p>This newest set of rules received unanimous support, and will now go through a final review by lawyers and the commission&#8217;s executive director.</p>
<p>This review won&#8217;t change any actual policies. Instead, it&#8217;s more of a formality to be sure the language in all documents is correct and error free.</p>
<p>From there, this new set of regulations will be officially filed with the Secretary of State. The CCC has until March 15 to file everything.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Yesterday&#8217;s approval came on the heels of a three-day debate last week in which lawmakers hashed out all sorts of fine-grained details.</p>
<p>In particular, the commission worked to address and incorporate feedback from <a href="https://hightimes.com/dispensaries/gov-baker-oks-waiver-for-massachusetts-1st-pot-dispensary/">Governor Charlie Baker</a> and other key policymakers.</p>
<p>Now that the commission has approved the state&#8217;s regulatory frameworks, they can set their sights on the next key deadline.</p>
<p>The CCC is supposed to start accepting applications from cannabis business owners on April 1.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>If the commission can make that happen on time, then it looks good for the state hitting its goal of <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/massachusetts-top-pot-regulator-committed-to-timely-rollout-of-law/">rolling out retail weed sales</a> on July 1.</p>
<h2>Final Hit: Marijuana Retail Sales In Massachusetts Closer Than Ever</h2>
<p>At this point, lawmakers and members of the CCC are optimistic that they can make the July 1 deadline.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think we have a lot of work to do in terms of building our staff and building our technology,&#8221; <a href="http://www.gloucestertimes.com/news/local_news/pot-regulations-ok-d-by-commission/article_8ccb2286-f215-5e56-b315-0d6569d3e329.html" rel="nofollow">said</a> CCC Chairman Steven Hoffman.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I think we have a good foundation based upon these regulations, so I am confident.&#8221;</p>
<p>He added: &#8220;Our intent is to have a go on July 1 and we are hitting all of the deadlines that we have in the legislation, so I&#8217;m feeling good about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the good news. But the bad news is that the state&#8217;s current laws and policies are very <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/massachusetts-lawmakers-justify-tinkering-with-marijuana-legalization/">different from what voters originally approved</a> in 2016.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentC -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc article_middleContentC dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>The first dramatic change came shortly after the vote when the state legislature passed a bill to delay retail sales. That delay bumped it back to the current deadline of July 1, 2018.</p>
<p>Then in 2017, Gov. Baker signed another bill. This one <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/massachusettss-latest-dick-move-rewriting-pot-legalization-in-secret/">raised taxes on weed</a> and gave individual municipalities the option to add even more taxes on top of the increased state tax.</p>
<p>Finally, one of the big things concerning many cannabis advocates is the provision that gives local communities the power to ban weed businesses. By November 2017, 115 communities had already chosen to implement cannabis bans.</p>
<p>Clearly, a lot of questions remain. Similarly, there is still a lot of work that state and local lawmakers need to do before everything is ready for weed businesses to open shop.</p>
<p>But at the moment, it appears that the state&#8217;s basic legal framework for recreational weed is more or less established.</p>

<p>The former major-league relief pitcher was fired as head baseball coach at Fort Worth&#8217;s Texas Wesleyan University after he sent a bizarre response to a high school senior in Aurora, Colo., who had expressed respectful interest in the program.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are not recruiting players from the state of Colorado,&#8221; Jeffcoat e-mailed 18-year-old Gavin Bell. &#8220;In the past, players have had trouble passing our drug test. We have made a decision to not take a chance on student-athletes from your state. You can thank your liberal politicians. Best of luck wherever you decide to play.&#8221;</p>

<p></p>
<p>The reference was clearly to Colorado&#8217;s liberal marijuana laws, which permit legal sales and possession of cannabis products. To date, <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2016/10/14/legal-marijuana-laws-by-state-map-united-states/62772/">19 states have legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use</a>.</p>
<p>Bell shared this startling message with his coaches and teachers, and the exchange went viral. TWU authorities fired Bell, making him approximately the 100 millionth American to learn the hard way that foolish or offensive e-mails and social media posts will come back to bite you.</p>
<p>TWU President Fred Slabach announced at a news conference that Jeffcoat &#8220;is no longer an employee &#8230; due to the discriminatory remarks contained in an email to a potential recruit from the state of Colorado,&#8221; as well as to an unrelated possible violation of player eligibility rules.</p>
<p>&#8220;My intention wasn&#8217;t trying to get this guy fired,&#8221; said Gavin, who really does seem like an awfully nice kid, in an interview with a Denver television station. &#8220;My intention was just to try to play baseball.&#8221;</p>

<hr>
<p>TWU didn&#8217;t respond when I e-mailed to ask whether it really has had an abundance of Colorado recruits flunking drug tests. They&#8217;re justifiably ready for this viral episode to exhaust its 15 minutes; Coloradans and their &#8220;liberal politicians&#8221; will no doubt make a full recovery as well.</p>
<p>What really struck me about the Jeffcoat imbroglio, though, was that it illustrates our utter inability to understand or address our nation&#8217;s deeply destructive drug problem.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s because the scourge is so widespread that no one in authority can seem to get beyond the margins, obsessing on one sub-issue at a time. While we have all been hyper-focused on opioid addictions to prescription painkillers and street drugs, there has reportedly been a furious resurgence in the prevalence of methamphetamines.</p>
<p>While this country wages war on south-of-the-border cartels, cheap new synthetics are pouring in from underground labs in China. While we bicker over whether Grandpa should be able to buy pot brownies to relieve his sciatica, legions of Americans know how to obtain illegal and unregulated drugs with the ease of buying a candy bar. We recognize the futility of imprisoning people for simple drug offenses, but we&#8217;re chronically short of treatment options.</p>

<p>We waste millions on testing employees in every sector for minor marijuana use. Yet some industries say they&#8217;re recruiting refugees from other countries because too many U.S. citizens flunk screenings for deadly drugs like heroin and meth.</p>
<p>We just don&#8217;t have enough fingers to poke in all these holes. And we lack a sense of proportion about which problems demand the most urgency. I&#8217;m no expert, but I doubt Colorado&#8217;s pot policy ranks at the top of the list.</p>
<p>It should be noted that Jeffcoat&#8217;s perspective might cost him some seriously valuable recruits. If current-day MLB greats Kris Bryant, Bryce Harper or Joey Gallo were just starting out today, Jeffcoat would give them a pass: All three are from Nevada, which allows recreational marijuana use. Washington, Colorado, Oregon and other states manage to balance legalized pot with valuable professional sports franchises and robust college programs.</p>
<p>Reducing drug use to <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/11/09/drug-tests-urine-doctors/92121/">a simple binomial screening test</a> &#8212; yes or no, pass or fail &#8212; completely ignores the complexities of this issue: which substances we can or cannot trust adults to use responsibly; why some treatments methods are more effective than others; the money involved in illegal drug sales; our inconsistent attitude toward alcohol and other intoxicants.</p>
<p>Most of all, we are getting nowhere on addressing the biggest question of all: Why do so many Americans crave escape from their everyday lives? That&#8217;s the question that underlies every overdose death, every cartel murder, every crooked doctor rung up for running a pill mill.</p>
<p>These are hard issues, and its sometimes seems that we &#8212; all of us, media included &#8212; do little besides talking in circles.</p>
<p>Drugs, in this country, have become as intractable and complex an issue as guns. Examining either through a lens of politics, rather than science or social policy or plain good sense, makes it all so much worse. And it leads some people, like the unfortunate former baseball coach, to make fools of themselves.</p>
<p>There are lot of reasons drugs are an appalling scourge affecting everyone from gang-plagued urban neighborhoods to desperate small towns where the good jobs are all gone and, yes, to athletes.</p>
<p>But I think we can let Colorado off the hook.</p>

<p>There are two main surveys that measure marijuana use among Colorado youth &#8212; one run by the federal government and one run by the state &#8212; and on this topic they agree. A large majority of Colorado high school students are not using marijuana regularly or even infrequently. And a still-sizable majority say they have never used marijuana.</p>
<p>The most recent data from the <a href="https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/sites/default/files/PF_Youth_HKCS_MJ-Infographic-Digital.pdf">Healthy Kids Colorado Survey</a>, which is run by the state, is from 2015 &#8212; so, one year after recreational marijuana sales began. (Survey data from 2017 should be available soon.)</p>
<p>In that survey, 62 percent of high school kids said they had never used marijuana, and 79 percent said they hadn&#8217;t used marijuana in the previous month.</p>

<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="12">The rights of LDS to purchase the memberships of both NHMC Inc. and CSPA Group Inc. were assigned to Kelly Christopherson, the current member of a medical cannabis nursery and a medical cannabis retailer located in Adelanto, CA. In exchange, Ms. Christopherson granted LDS a five-year option to purchase the NHMC, Inc. and CSPA Group, Inc. memberships for one hundred U.S. dollars (US$100.00) each. The assignment was made to facilitate the transfer of the permits described below by the City of Adelanto. On February 21, 2018, the NHMC, Inc. and CSPA Group, Inc. memberships were purchased for one million two hundred and fifty thousand U.S. dollars (US$1,250,000.00) and three million (3,000,000) shares of LDS common stock. The two companies hold three permits in the city of Adelanto in California &#226;&#128;&#148; a Volatile Extraction and Manufacturing permit, a Cultivation permit and a Transportation and Distribution permit. Brad Eckenweiler, CEO of LDS, stated, &#8220;The early completion of the NHMC Inc. and CSPA Group Inc. membership purchase was, I believe, beneficial for all parties involved and we appreciate the work that the Davises contributed to the project.&#8221; The changes in the California regulations during late 2017 made the acceleration of the membership purchase of both NHMC Inc. and CSPA Group Inc. possible.

Blood</strong>, <em> Associated Press</em></p>                                                <p>LOS ANGELES &#8212; American Indian tribes that say they have been cut out of California&#8217;s legal marijuana market have raised the possibility of going their own way by establishing pot businesses outside the state-regulated system that is less than two months old.</p>
<p>The tribes floated the idea of setting up rival farms and sales shops on reservations after concluding that rules requiring them to be licensed by the state would strip them of authority over their own lands and their right to self-governance.</p>
<p>The possibility of the tribes breaking away from the state-run system is one more challenge for California as it attempts to transform its longstanding medicinal and illegal marijuana markets into a unified, multibillion-dollar industry.</p>
<p>For tribes to participate in the state-run market, &#8220;they have to give up their rights to act as governments, with regard to cannabis,&#8221; said Mark Levitan, a tribal attorney.</p>
<p>At issue are legally thorny questions about who governs whom, taxation and the intersection of state marijuana laws with tribes that the federal government recognizes as sovereign nations within the U.S.</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Related: <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/10/02/american-indian-tribes-marijuana-industry/89126/">Tribes urged to consider boosting revenue via cannabis industry</a></strong></p>
<hr>
<p>Under regulations issued last year, California would retain full control over licensing. Tribes would have to follow state rules, including &#8220;submission to all enforcement,&#8221; to obtain a license to grow or sell marijuana. Any application must include a waiver of &#8220;sovereign immunity,&#8221; a sort of legal firewall that protects tribal interests.</p>
<p>Without state licenses, businesses cannot take part in the legal state pot market. California has over 100 federally recognized tribes, the most of any state, and estimates of the number either growing and selling pot or eager to do so varies, from a handful to over 20.</p>
<p>Unlike those that have prospered from casino gambling, some are in struggling rural areas and would welcome a new source of cash to improve schools and pave roads.</p>
<p>After long-running negotiations between tribes and state officials failed to produce an agreement before broad legal sales began Jan. 1, the California Native American Cannabis Association warned state officials that tribes &#8220;may engage in commercial cannabis activities through our own inherent sovereign authority.&#8221;</p>
<p>If tribes choose to step away from California&#8217;s market, &#8220;the state will have no jurisdiction to enforce its cannabis laws and regulations on tribal lands,&#8221; the group said in a sharply worded letter to Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown&#8217;s administration in December.</p>
<p>Tribes &#8220;just want to be able to do business in the state of California and elsewhere, just like anybody else,&#8221; said Paul Chavez, former chairman of the Bishop Paiute tribe.</p>

<p>The dispute in California differs from another legal pot state, Washington, where seven tribes have marijuana compacts with the state and others are in negotiations or awaiting the governor&#8217;s approval. The compacts allow tribal marijuana businesses to participate in the legal system, such as selling tribe-grown pot to retailers off the reservation.</p>
<p>In California, the tribes are circulating a proposal that calls for the governor to strike agreements with them. Those pacts would allow them to participate in the legal market, while the state would recognize a tribe&#8217;s &#8220;exclusive authority&#8221; to regulate commercial marijuana activity on its lands.</p>
<p>Tribes are eager for a settlement, but reaching a deal in the Legislature could take the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone agrees conceptually there should be an even playing field, a level playing field,&#8221; said state Assemblyman Rob Bonta, a Democrat at the center of the negotiations in Sacramento.</p>
<p>In addition to the problems in Sacramento, tribes are facing uncertainty at the federal level.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/04/jeff-sessions-rescinding-legalized-marijuana-policy/95875/">lifted an Obama-era policy</a> that kept federal authorities from cracking down on the marijuana trade in states where the drug is legal, which also guided enforcement on tribal lands.</p>
<p>The shifting ground has put a chill over development plans &#8212; including in an isolated stretch of eastern San Diego County.</p>
<p>Nevada-based GB Sciences Inc. announced last year that it would build and manage a commercial cannabis company on tribal lands, nurturing plants, manufacturing products and distributing them across the state.</p>
<p>The tribe, the Los Coyotes Band of Cahuilla and Cupeno Indians, would get an ownership stake, jobs and 40 percent of the profits. GB Sciences would get income for its marijuana research and a foothold in the largest legal pot market in the U.S.</p>
<p>But the projected $8 million project is on hold, with the status of tribes in the pot market unclear.</p>
<p>Issues involving sovereignty touch a sensitive subject for tribes, and they see the predicament with marijuana as part of a history of exploitation.</p>
<p>The state rule &#8220;harkens back to the end of the 19th century &#8230; when federal and state policies favored extermination or forced assimilation of California tribes,&#8221; the tribal group wrote.</p>

    			<p>Nevada retailers sold nearly $200 million worth of recreational cannabis since adult-use sales began six months ago, surpassing the total revenue generated by Colorado and Washington state in the early months of their recreational markets.</p>
<p><span id="more-86732"></span></p>
<p>Nevada&#8217;s higher sales totals relative to other adult-use markets are driven by several factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nevada&#8217;s <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/nevada-retailers-still-targeting-july-1-rec-marijuana-start-amid-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early start program</a> &#8211; which allowed licensed dispensaries to sell recreational marijuana while final rules for the adult-use program were ironed out&#160;&#8211; proved extremely successful. Despite initial hurdles regarding <a href="https://mjbizdaily.com/nevada-supreme-court-halts-cannabis-distribution-licensing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannabis distribution licenses</a>, the state was generally well prepared to handle the influx of new recreational customers.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Over 40 million visitors travel to Las Vegas each year, many of whom visit the city primarily for vacation or leisure purposes.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Today&#8217;s cannabis industry is very different than it was in 2014, when Colorado and Washington state launched adult-use sales. Branding and retailing practices have advanced significantly, and stores now offer a larger assortment of products that appeal to both new and experienced consumers &#8211; such as low-dose edibles and high-potency concentrates &#8211; that weren&#8217;t widely available in rec markets just a few years ago.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="http://info.mjfreeway.com/opt-in-consulting" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-66014" src="https://mjbizdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2.26_MJ_BizAd300x250-01-1.png" alt="" width="300"></a>Nevada&#8217;s adult-use program has certainly gotten off to a hot start, but rec sales in Colorado and Washington state have grown by leaps and bounds in the years since launch.</p>
<p>Currently, average monthly sales in Nevada are just over $32 million, while Colorado and Washington state&#8217;s average monthly sales over the latest six months of available data are $96.7 million and $79.7 million, respectively.</p>
<p>Whether rec sales in Nevada will grow as dramatically remains to be seen and will depend on how certain aspects of Nevada&#8217;s market develop.</p>
<p>A few things to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of retail stores allowed in Nevada will be based on a county&#8217;s population, with initial estimates suggesting this will be around 130 statewide &#8211; fewer stores per capita than any other recreational market. Washington state and Colorado have each issued over 500 adult-use retail licenses.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Rec sales in Nevada have yet to&#160;rise in two consecutive months. This suggests the market is fueled by tourist spending, as sales in Colorado and Washington state &#8211; two markets where in-state residents form the bedrock of the adult-use customer base &#8211; continued to rise for several months before experiencing any month over month declines.</li>

<p>BOISE, Idaho (<em>AP</em>) &#8212; An Idaho Senate panel on Tuesday vacated a decision that halted a proposal to legalize oil extracted from cannabis plants because it was held after an open meeting violation.</p>
<p>Senate Health and Welfare Chairman Lee Heider, a Republican from Twin Falls, asked to vacate Monday&#8217;s vote on HB 577 during the panel&#8217;s Tuesday meeting.</p>
<p>&#8220;The chair acknowledges violation of Senate Rule 20, in that an unnoticed and unapproved executive session occurred,&#8221; Heider said in front of his committee.</p>
<p>Heider then asked for unanimous consent to &#8220;set aside the vote on March 5&#8221; &#8212; which was granted by the committee.</p>
<p>Under HB 577, Idahoans would be allowed to legally use cannabidiol, otherwise known as CBD oil, for medical purposes.</p>
<p>The oil comes from cannabis but contain little or no THC. Supporters tout CBDs as a supplement that can help alleviate pain, reduce stress and improve skin health, although there&#8217;s little data on whether they work or what kind of side effects they might have.</p>
<p>Heider had previously said he wouldn&#8217;t give the bill a hearing because Gov. C.L. &#8220;Butch&#8221; Otter opposed the legislation.</p>
<p>However, Heider raised eyebrows Monday by halting a public meeting to ask members to meet in private about HB 577.</p>
<p>Heider stopped the meeting because Sen. Tony Potts, a Republican from Idaho Falls, attempted to force the bill forward making an unannounced motion to schedule a hearing on the issue. Such actions are unusual for legislative committees.</p>
<p>While Potts talked in support of the advancing the bill, Heider gaveled him down and huddled members into his office.</p>
<p>Shouting could be heard from inside Heider&#8217;s office and the group only broke up after being warned by a reporter that lawmakers were likely violating the Open Meeting Law.</p>
<p>&#8220;The governor&#8217;s office doesn&#8217;t want this bill,&#8221; Heider could be heard shouting while explaining why he wouldn&#8217;t give the bill a hearing.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still unknown if Heider will allow the bill to advance by giving it a hearing. Yet, his actions have sparked criticism from CBD advocates and political candidates who have used the issue to criticize the current administration.</p>
<p>&#8220;If this administration has real valid reasons to oppose the CBD oil legislation, they should present them in a public, open forum,&#8221; said U.S. Rep. Raul Labrador, who is running in the GOP gubernatorial primary. &#8220;They should defeat ideas in committee, not hide behind a committee chairman to avoid the public debate.&#8221;</p>
<p>Labrador also accused Lt. Gov. Brad Little &#8212; who is also running for governor &#8212; of remaining on the sidelines while Otter usurped the legislative process.</p>
<p>Little hadn&#8217;t seen Labrador&#8217;s statement when asked by reporters on Tuesday and declined to respond directly to Labrador&#8217;s attack. Little added that he supported &#8220;quality-controlled CBD oil,&#8221; but had not yet read HB 577.</p>
<p>&#8220;From an administrative side, I&#8217;m glad Lee fessed up,&#8221; Little said. &#8220;Obviously, it was circumvention.&#8221;</p>
<p>Otter&#8217;s spokesman said the Republican governor was traveling Monday and declined to comment further.</p>
<p>Otter vetoed similar legislation in 2015 and has since said his stance on CBD oil had not changed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, fellow GOP opponent Tommy Ahlquist&#8217;s campaign also released a statement criticizing Otter.</p>
<p>&#8220;Since day one, Tommy has supported the legalization of CBD oil that helps sick people as long as the THC is removed and it&#8217;s prescribed by a doctor,&#8221; said David Johnston, Ahlquist&#8217;s campaign manager.</p>

The judge in the case, looking over a depleted jury pool, ruled that there were not enough prospective jurors to proceed, and declared a mistrial.<br>
</p>
<div id="leafly-dfp-ad-widget-mobile-medium-rectangle-1237049116" class="leafly-dfp-ad-container">    </div>
<p>The trial has been re-scheduled for mid-July.</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">Prospective jurors questioned the decision to bring charges, even before the judge declared a mistrial. </div>
<p>The early dismissal disappointed some courtroom observers, who were anticipating one of the first high-profile cases to be prosecuted under Denver&#8217;s post-legalization public consumption law.</p>
<p>Three founding members of the <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/lifestyle/inside-denvers-international-church-of-cannabis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Church of Cannabis</a> stand accused by Denver city officials of violating Colorado&#8217;s Clean Indoor Air Act. They have also been cited for complicity in the public consumption of cannabis during what was billed as a private 4/20 service at the church. The 4/20 service also served as the high point of the Church&#8217;s official opening day.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/lifestyle/inside-denvers-international-church-of-cannabis"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/26104805/cannabis-church-1-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">A &#8216;Higher&#8217; Calling: Inside Denver&#8217;s International Church of Cannabis</div></div></a></div>
<h2>A Private Event on 4/20</h2>
<p>The charges were filed after several undercover police officers entered the church and attended the April 20<sup>th</sup> event on the unofficial marijuana holiday. The church first had visiting hours for the public, and then held the private invitation-only service at 4:20 p.m.</p>
<p>Prosecutors claim that the defendants were complicit in fostering the public use of cannabis in an enclosed space. They have not been charged with public use.</p>
<p>But those defendants counter that they met with Denver city attorneys several days before the 4/20 event last year, specifically to ask how they could hold their 4/20 ceremony and remain in compliance with city laws. They also claim that the event was private and not open to the public. Therefore, they say, it should not violate the city&#8217;s public consumption laws.</p>
<h2>Not Enough Jurors</h2>
<p>Soon after preliminary interviews of jurors by the prosecution and defense, the judge announced that the jury pool of 24, which was whittled down to 15, was not large enough to seat the six necessary jurors. Therefore, the trial would not be able to proceed.</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">''I pay taxes and wonder how my tax dollars are being utilized,'' one juror told the judge.</div>
<p>&#8220;Each side had six preemptory challenges,&#8221; defense attorney Warren Edson after the judge&#8217;s decision. &#8220;So if you take 12 away from 15, we didn&#8217;t have six.&#8221;</p>
<p>Before both sides agreed to the mistrial, the judge questioned several jurors. That&#8217;s when things got interesting. Several <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/jury-acquits-nice-guy-who-admitted-selling-cannabis-to-a-cop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jurors questioned</a> whether such a case was necessary in a state that legalized recreational, adult-use cannabis more than four years earlier.</p>
<p>&#8220;I pay taxes and wonder how my tax dollars are being utilized,&#8221; one juror told the judge.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m struggling with the amount of resources put towards this,&#8221; said another, who also noted that Denver Police at the city&#8217;s Red Rocks Amphitheater often &#8220;look the other way&#8221; when encountering cannabis-smokers at the famous open-air concert venue.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/jury-acquits-nice-guy-who-admitted-selling-cannabis-to-a-cop"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/15105744/jury-nullification-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Jury Acquits &#8216;Nice Guy&#8217; Who Admitted Selling Cannabis to a Cop</div></div></a></div>
<p>Defense attorney Warren Edson was pleased with the pushback. &#8220;It was nice to see the citizens of Denver bring up the point&#8212;not me, they did&#8212;that geez, the city seems to be spending a lot of time and money on this case,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>There do seem to be a lot of resources spent on a relatively minor infraction, if an infraction did indeed occur. The charges listed each carry a maximum penalty of $300. The case has already gone through at least five pretrial hearings.</p>
<p>The risk for the defendants could be substantially greater, though. While the public consumption charge is only a public nuisance crime, Edson said the city can conceivably file forfeiture paperwork against the International Church of Cannabis if the defendants are found guilty. &#8220;And that is where this is headed,&#8221; he said.</p>
<h2>This Is &#8216;Religious Persecution,&#8217; Says Defendant</h2>
<p>Denver City Attorney&#8217;s Office did not respond to requests for comment on the mistrial or the International Church of Cannabis case.</p>
<p>Church co-founder Steve Berke, one of the defendants at the trial, said the city doesn&#8217;t believe &#8220;that our principles are deeply-held religious beliefs. This comes down, in my opinion, to religious persecution.&#8221;</p>
<p>As prosecutors and the defense team prepares for the rescheduled trial in July, the City of Denver continues to move forward with licenses for public cannabis consumption spaces. Earlier this week a Denver coffee shop <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2018/02/26/denver-approves-first-social-marijuana-license/">received approval</a> for what may be the city&#8217;s first business license to allow customers to enjoy on-site cannabis use.</p>

											    	<p>It&#8217;s no secret that LeBron James might be making his last playoff run as a Cavalier.</p>
<p>Sure, it&#8217;s Oscar season and the NBA campaign is six weeks away from being over, but it&#8217;s never too early to start talking about King James&#8217; much-anticipated free-agent decision.</p>
<p>This past week, in a stunt inspired by Oscar-favorite <em>Three Billboards Outside of Ebbing, Missouri</em>, three billboards practically <a href="http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/22596146/cleveland-cavaliers-star-lebron-james-says-flattered-billboards-recruiting-join-philadelphia-76ers" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">begging</a> LeBron to sign in Philadelphia were put up about seven miles outside of Cleveland.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone " src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7aTnQqygA3TcukFi/giphy.gif" width="668" height="376"></p>
<p>But are the Sixers a realistic choice?</p>
<p>With their young nucleus, they seem to be. But what about other teams loom large this summer for LeBron&#8217;s big decision?</p>
<h4>Philadelphia 76ers</h4>
<p>Sam Hinkie, the former 76ers GM and mastermind behind &#8220;The Process,&#8221; doesn&#8217;t look so bad anymore.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone " src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l4FGqK8Dh3W3YmpwI/giphy.gif" width="629" height="354"></p>
<p>It took a lot of time and losing, but the Sixers have developed into one of the best young teams in the league. With two transcendent talents in Joel Embiid and Ben Simmons, LeBron James would make that team the most dangerous in the Eastern Conference.</p>
<p>Signing James, and adding much more shooting, would complete The Process.</p>
<h4>Los Angeles Lakers</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone " src="https://media.giphy.com/media/26vIfKDKOw34lHRks/giphy.gif" width="636" height="358"></p>
<p>There were reports last summer that LeBron James to the Lakers was practically a done deal. Now, nothing is ever for sure with LeBron until he signs on the dotted line, but the Lakers absolutely make sense.</p>
<p>While the Lakers have been one of the worst teams in the NBA over the last half decade, the team has a fun, young nucleus that includes rookie Kyle Kuzma, budding star Brandon Ingram and a point guard who doesn&#8217;t need the ball and can play solid defense in Lonzo Ball.</p>
<p>But why would LeBron want to join a team that hasn&#8217;t been to the playoffs since 2011?</p>
<p>James, 33, has already started to build his empire, that includes his production company that is based in Los Angeles. He also owns more than $50 million in real estate in the L.A. area.</p>
<p>The Lakers will have cap space for LeBron and one other max star, say Paul George? And if LeBron doesn&#8217;t want to deal with the LaVar ball headache, the Lakers can always trade Lonzo for a nice haul.</p>
<h4>Cleveland Cavaliers</h4>
<p><img class="alignnone " src="https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7btLPD9OZCxRbiIU/giphy.gif" width="626" height="352"></p>
<p>Don&#8217;t count out James staying at home with the Cavaliers.</p>
<p>Although James and Cavs owner Dan Gilbert reportedly don&#8217;t have a working relationship, LeBron still runs that team and obviously feels comfortable with the franchise.</p>
<p>Before the trade deadline, this looked like a long shot, but Cleveland upgraded in talent around LeBron, surrounding him with more shooting and athleticism.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t the best option for LeBron, but will he stay with the hometown squad or leave them high and dry again?</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll find out in July.</p>

											    	<p>When I first heard that there was an opportunity for <em>DOPE Magazine </em>to cover <em>The 4th Annual Hollywood Beauty Awards, </em>my initial reaction was intrigue and surprise. Surprising because it&#8217;s not every day that you see cannabis media outlets covering Hollywood award shows, but intriguing because they were specifically looking for coverage of their <em>#HighOnBeauty </em>campaign. The <em>Hollywood Beauty Awards </em>recognizes the architects of beauty in hair, makeup, photography and styling in Film, TV and Music, as well as those artists who create celebrity looks for the red carpet and editorial. Pamela Price, the Vice President of the <em>HBA&#8217;s, </em>had also clued me in that they would be awarding <em>CBD For Life, </em>a CBD infused pain management and beauty product line, <em>Product Line of the Year</em>. This was also to be the <em>HBA&#8217;s </em>first cannabis product ever awarded.</p>

<p>So with suit in hand, I made my way from Las Vegas to Los Angeles to attend the <em>Hollywood Beauty Awards </em>at <em>Avalon Hollywood </em>on Vine<em>. </em>Upon arriving, I met fellow <em>DOPE-fam </em>member Dan Schmink, who was styled vibrantly in his dapper blue plaid suit. We had a quick get-to-know-ya toke to ease the nerves and headed to find our position on the green carpet. Once we tested our WiFi connection, we MacGyvered a cell phone mount to our tripod rental and set the stage for an electric two hour live stream on <em>DOPE&#8217;s Instagram </em>profile.</p>
<figure id="attachment_34635" style="max-width: 746px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-34635" src="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kerry-Washington_Sam-Jackson_Elizabeth-Banks.jpg" alt="Hollywood Gets #HIGHONBEAUTY - Hollywood Beauty Awards" width="746" height="1100" srcset="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kerry-Washington_Sam-Jackson_Elizabeth-Banks.jpg 746w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kerry-Washington_Sam-Jackson_Elizabeth-Banks-694x1024.jpg 694w" sizes="(max-width: 746px) 100vw, 746px"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Kerry Washington, Samuel L Jackson, Elizabeth Banks (Hollywood Beauty Awards)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The presenters, nominees, and those receiving awards started arriving around 5PM. It was a whirlwind of celebrities, fashionistas, and some of the most talented artists on the planet. I moved back and forth between the live stream and the photographer pit to capture as much content as possible. We were surrounded by media outlets with microphones and camera crews, but it didn&#8217;t stop us from getting interviews with A-list talent. One of the first celebs to stop and discuss cannabis with us was Smokey Robinson<em>. </em>He received the Gentleman&#8217;s Award that evening for his kind heart toward those around him throughout his music career. Smokey doesn&#8217;t spark up nowadays, but is very excited and happy for those who now have access to cannabis.</p>
<p>We also spoke to a number of cannabis-friendly nominees and awardees about CBD and cannabis within their fields; such as Ellen Mirojnick, Matthew VanLeeuwen, Camille Friend, Joel Harlow, Riawna Capri, Johnny Wright, and Sarah Tanno, the personal makeup artist for CBD advocate, Lady Gaga.</p>

<p>Some of the other stars that made it to <em>The Hollywood Beauty Awards </em>to support their friends and colleagues being awarded were Kat Graham, Lionel Richie, Danielle Savre, Elizabeth Banks, Tinashe, Danai Gurira, Angie Everhart, Cheech Marin, Kelly Washington, Jane Seymour, Britney Spears, and my dude, Samuel L. Jackson. Sam even took the time to let me know that while he &#8220;hasn&#8217;t smoked weed since the 90s,&#8221; he is still in full support of what is happening with cannabis in America.</p>

<p>Cannabis is still a touchy subject for many people. Not everyone who I spoke with was thrilled to talk about marijuana, but as journalists and writers it is our duty to ask the questions no one else is willing to ask. The <em>HBA&#8217;s </em>are a beacon of hope for cannabis within the health and beauty industry. President and founder, Michele Elyzabeth, intends to increase the amount of cannabis influence each year, so that the true medicinal value of the plant can continue to be recognized by Hollywood and mainstream America.</p>

<p>Will this pattern hold for California? It seems likely. We spoke to Dr. Jonathan Vaught, Founder and CEO of Front Range Biosciences, to get his insight. Currently, Front Range Biosciences is headquartered in Boulder, Colorado, but Vaught sees California as their next step for expansion. So far, he&#8217;s found trying to acquire California property as a canna-business owner, an interesting experience, to say the least.</p>
<h5><em>DOPE Magazine:</em> What hoops have you had to jump through to find real estate in California?</h5>
<p><strong><em>Dr. Jonathan Vaught:</em></strong> Finding real estate for cannabis definitely has its challenges. With the massive wave of legalization across the world, there has been increased demand for commercial real estate in certain hotspots or major markets&#8212;California in particular. Given that many agricultural companies doing crop production and nursery operations have been moved overseas, these real estate assets have been left unused for well over a decade, sometimes more. Dilapidated old greenhouses and warehouses are now going for as much as ten times what they used to cost on a per-square-foot basis. Because of the poor state of many properties, significant capital investments are required, which is challenging for a startup company.</p>

<p>In addition, many landlords and property owners are more reluctant to rent to cannabis businesses, which further drives up prices and perpetuates the notion that cannabis companies should pay significantly higher rent. However, just like any other agricultural crop, this one will eventually get commoditized, and business owners will not be able to afford the astronomical prices currently seen. This is already starting to happen in certain markets where cannabis cultivators cannot afford their rent anymore, given the falling price per pound of product.</p>
<p>We have had to be extremely persistent and use our network to connect with property owners, real estate agents and consultants to help identify good properties. I think the biggest pitfalls are the uncertain local regulations. Many counties and municipalities in California are still working on their regulations, which can make a property either suitable or not for cannabis, depending on the type of license required. With the possibility that regulations could change, there is significant risk to investing heavily in a particular property until the local government has issued their final regulations. This has apparently happened to several groups that had built large operations that are [now] no longer permitted [to operate] under the latest version of local regulations.</p>
<h5>What has been the hardest (and, alternatively, easiest) part of getting your business set up in California?</h5>
<p>It&#8217;s a very competitive space, with the powerful agricultural companies that fuel much of California&#8217;s economy watching the industry very closely, lobbying at state and local levels, and even making investments. There is also significant competition from the traditional cannabis producers that have been operating in California for decades. However, given the state&#8217;s existing infrastructure to support agricultural companies, there are many reasons why setting up in California also has its advantages. Legislators, businesses and regulators are all very used to working together to support an agricultural-driven economy.</p>
<h5>Why did you choose California?</h5>
<p>California will be the largest legal cannabis market in the world. It will also be one of the largest producers of cannabis in the world, given its climate and infrastructure to support large-scale crop production. With our Clean Stock&#8482; nursery program, it makes the most sense for our company to be right in the middle of the largest cannabis-producing region in the world, where demand for our product is highest.</p>

<p>Thanks to a <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> activism group selling &#8216;Jeff Sessions&#8217; rolling papers, you can now send a clear political message the next time you roll up.

<p>The cannabis activism group selling &#8216;Jeff Sessions&#8217; rolling papers calls itself simply #JeffSesh. The group&#8217;s <a href="http://https://jeff-sesh.squarespace.com" rel="nofollow">website</a>&#160;sells two versions of what they&#8217;re calling General Jeff&#8217;s Sessions Papers. One comes in a black box and the other comes in a white box.</p>
<p>Each box design features a picture of <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/lawsuit-jeff-sessions-court-tomorrow/">Attorney General Jeff Sessions</a>&#8216; face right in the center. He&#8217;s got a joint in his mouth, and it looks like his eyes may be slightly red. Each box comes with 50 papers, and celebrates the fact that these Jeff Sessions papers are part of a &#8220;Limited 1st Edition.&#8221;</p>
<p>The group behind these genius <a href="https://hightimes.com/products/best-rolling-papers-2017/">rolling papers</a> is working to make a political statement while also maintaining a sense of humor. To that end, they&#8217;ve really elevated the world of cannabis puns.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>The rolling paper boxes advertise 50 &#8220;sessions&#8221; per box. Similarly, the top of the box reminds consumers to &#8220;Please Sesh Responsibly.&#8221; Finally, playing on Sessions&#8217; middle name, the very bottom of the box has the line: &#8220;Don&#8217;t Beauregard That Joint, My Friend!&#8221;</p>
<h2>Final Hit: Cannabis Activism Group Selling &#8216;Jeff Sessions&#8217; Rolling Papers</h2>

<p>The group&#8217;s website is equally punny in articulating its pro-cannabis politics. According to the site, the Jeff Sessions-themed rolling papers are part of a larger campaign to tell <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/heres-jeff-sessions-latest-attack-marijuana/">Jeff Sessions</a>:</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not criminals, junkies or idiots. Regular Jeffs all over the country&#8212;good, responsible, patriotic Americans&#8212;have a sesh now and then . . . and it&#8217;s OK!&#8221;</p>
<p>Additionally, the group provides a number of key stats about weed. Many of them fly in the face of the prohibitionist <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/more-marijuana-myths-jeff-sessions-slams-legalization-again/">myths</a> Sessions himself so often perpetuates.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>&#8220;Cannabis provides relief and uplifting energy to millions of users, from serious medical patients in 29 states to recreational consumers in 8 states,&#8221; the site says. &#8220;<a href="https://hightimes.com/news/legalization/states-pass-marijuana-laws-year/">12 states are considering new legalization</a> measures this year. Every time you sesh with any brand of JeffSesh papers, you&#8217;re helping keep the law moving forward&#8212;and not back to the <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/white-house-confession-the-war-on-weed-is-racist/">Nixon era</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jeff Sessions is a logical target for a cannabis activist group. Throughout his entire political career, Sessions has been an outspoken opponent of weed.</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/12/jeff-sessions-coming-war-on-legal-marijuana-214501" rel="nofollow">example</a>, he once said the KKK was &#8220;OK until I found out they smoked pot.&#8221; Similarly, Sessions also said that &#8220;good people don&#8217;t smoke marijuana.&#8221; And finally, he regularly calls cannabis a &#8220;very real danger&#8221; and rails against it as &#8220;not the kind of thing that ought to be legalized.&#8221;</p>
<p>More recently, the Attorney General suggested that cannabis is to <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/jeff-sessions-blames-marijuana-opioid-crisis/">blame for the opioid crisis</a>. While commenting on the opioid epidemic at a Heritage Foundation event, Sessions claimed that &#8220;a lot of this is starting with marijuana or other drugs, too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Sessions&#8217; anti-weed propaganda is extending into policy. Earlier this year, he <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/jeff-sessions-anti-pot-federal-crackdown-full-force/">rescinded an Obama-era policy</a> prohibiting federal resources from going after states with legal cannabis programs.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>Owning your <a href="https://hightimes.com/business/5-tips-to-start-a-successful-and-legal-grow-operation/">own grow operation</a> can be tough, especially in inclement weather conditions. Typically, it&#8217;s traditional outdoor setups that are <a href="https://hightimes.com/grow/nicos-nuggets-tips-on-growing-marijuana-outdoors/">most afflicted by mother nature</a>. However, there&#160;can notable exceptions. Take this recent case, for example, where melted&#160;snow on a roof leads to marijuana bust worth over $100,000.</p>
<h2>A Conspicuous Roof</h2>
<p>Storm Emma continues to wreak havoc amongst the U.K., with some areas expected to see almost two feet of snow. Nonetheless, it was actually a noticeable lack of snow that resulted in one illegal grow operation&#8217;s downfall.</p>
<p>On Friday, police shut down a marijuana grow farm worth around &#163;80,000, (or in U.S. terms, $110,000), after noticing the roof had little snow on it.</p>
<p>This was, of course, because of the heat given off by the <a href="https://hightimes.com/grow/nicos-nuggets-how-to-compare-cannabis-grow-lights/">high powered grow-lights</a>, which melted the majority of the snow on the roof.</p>
<p>According to the&#160;<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5453881/Police-80-000-cannabis-farm-seeing-snow-free-roof.html" rel="nofollow">Daily Mail</a>, police entered the house after smelling a strong cannabis odor outside of the house, in addition to the noticeable lack of snow.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>There, they found about 322 cannabis plants spread throughout all four bedrooms of the house and the cellar.</p>
<p>PC Caroline Foster of the West Yorkshire Police, who was a part of the drug bust, proudly tweeted the department&#8217;s findings on her personal Twitter account.</p>
<p>&#8220;Whilst the snow has kept the burglars at bay it has also helped us in finding some rather large plants,&#8221; Foster said.&#160;&#8220;Hmmm, I wonder why there is no snow on your roof? 280+ plants seized from an address in Keighley today, some nearly 6ft tall.&#8221;</p>
<p>Vicky Watson, who lives directly next to the since-exposed cannabis operation, told the Daily Mail that there were several signs of a marijuana farm.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">

<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8220;In the cold weather my house is normally freezing because the insulation is rubbish, but since they moved in next door my bathroom has been absolutely red hot. The wall was warm to touch,&#8221; Watson explained.</p>
<p class="mol-para-with-font">&#8220;It was suspicious, you could hear fans whirring but no normal sounds of people living there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Another anonymous neighbor praised the West Yorkshire Police for their discovery.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well done for the police turning out on such a freezing cold day to take those drugs off the streets. Now those cannabis farmers have lost their crop I dread to think how they are going to afford their leccy [electricity] bill.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;Melted Snow on A Roof Leads To Marijuana Bust Worth Over $100,000</h2>
<p>Despite police uncovering the large grow operation, no formal arrests have been made, as there was no one in the house at the time of the discovery.</p>
<p>The only lead, if you can call it that, was from Watson, who described her neighbors as&#160;&#8216;Two Eastern European blokes, in their 30s.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>ALONG THE NORTHEAST CORRIDOR (<em>AP</em>) &#8212; Marijuana, specifically legalizing it for recreational use, was a hot topic Thursday aboard New Jersey&#8217;s annual cocktail party on rails.</p>
<p>For more than eight decades New Jersey&#8217;s business leaders, lobbyists and politicians pack a chartered Amtrak train for Washington, making it part boozy networking event, part lobbying session.</p>
<p>Thursday&#8217;s event comes as Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy begins a push for legalization of marijuana. Democratic lawmakers in the state Senate have drafted a bill and held hearings, but now that Murphy succeeded Republican Chris Christie, a vocal opponent of legalization, legislators are hesitating.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve said from the outset that we&#8217;re going to try to do a thorough job for the people of New Jersey,&#8221; Democratic Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin said. Coughlin has scheduled a hearing on marijuana legalization for Monday.</p>
<p>Other Democrats aboard the train seemed skeptical. Democratic Assemblywoman Annette Quijanao said she&#8217;s still reviewing the issue and hasn&#8217;t made up her mind. Democratic state Sen. Bob Gordon says he&#8217;s opposed but open to considering legalization. Republicans look less likely to embrace it.</p>
<p>Senate Republican Leader Tom Kean Jr., seated next to his father, former GOP Gov. Tom Kean Sr., said he&#8217;s opposed.</p>
<p>Murphy says he favors legalization based on criminal and racial justice philosophies but also that the estimated $300 million in state revenue would help finance his other promises, like increased pension payments and greater school aid.</p>
<p>Murphy&#8217;s first budget is due in just under two weeks. He said he will outline his budget priorities in an address to the train delegation in Washington on Thursday.</p>
<p>Also speaking to the delegation will be New Jersey&#8217;s U.S. senators, Cory Booker and Bob Menendez, both Democrats.</p>
<p>The train party is typically an opportunity for entrepreneurs and lobbyists to deepen relationships with lawmakers, but it also gives the state&#8217;s leaders &#8212; particularly the governor &#8212; a chance to frame an agenda.</p>
<p>Christie, for example, last year touted his accomplishments and warned the then-candidates running to succeed him not to over-promise.</p>
<p>This year, Democrats are energized over the prospects of picking up seats in Congress.</p>
<p>State Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg, a Democrat, said New Jersey Republicans will have a hard time distancing themselves from President Donald Trump, who is unpopular in the state.</p>
<p>&#8220;We certainly as a party more closely represent the values of a majority of the residents of the state,&#8221; Weinberg said</p>
<p>Kean Jr., who&#8217;s not on the ballot this year, said he&#8217;s focused on policies to make New Jersey more affordable. But how will the president affect Republicans on the ballot?</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll see,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to the research published in the journal </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Neuropsychopharmacology</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, clinical trial data showed that when cannabis was administered alongside &#8220;sub-therapeutic doses&#8221; of oxycodone, the two worked synergistically to relieve the patient&#8217;s pain as effectively as a higher dose of strictly oxycodone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted by a team of researchers from the United States and Australia. Subjects were divided into three groups. One was administered inhaled cannabis, the other low-dose oxycodone and the third received both. Researchers examined their response over the course of treatment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The study showed that neither the low-dose oxycodone nor the smoked cannabis subsided the subjects&#8217; pain alone, but the combination of the two proved effective.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Both active cannabis and a low dose of oxycodone (2.5 mg) were sub-therapeutic, failing to elicit analgesia on their own,&#8221; said </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41386-018-0011-2"><span style="font-weight: 400">the study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. &#8220;However, when administered together, pain responses &#8230; were significantly reduced, pointing to the opioid-sparing effects of cannabis.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Smoked cannabis combined with an ineffective analgesic dose of oxycodone produced analgesia comparable to an effective opioid analgesic dose.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A </span><a href="http://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/hub/journal/10.1002/(ISSN)1532-6535/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">similar study</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> conducted in 2011 found similar results with vaporized cannabis. That study shows states with legalized medical marijuana have seen a reduction in not only fatal overdoses but painkiller prescriptions overall.</span></p>

<p class="canvas-atom canvas-text Mb(1.0em) Mb(0)--sm Mt(0.8em)--sm" data-reactid="13">For the three months ended December 31, 2017, we reported our highest quarterly revenues on record of approximately $990,000, representing an increase of 27% in total revenues when compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016.&#194;&#160; Annual revenues in 2017 increased by $540,000 to approximately $3,522,000, or 15%, when compared to annual 2016 revenues of approximately $2,982,000.</p>
<ul class="canvas-list List(d)" data-type="list" data-reactid="14">
<li data-reactid="15">These increases were driven by record revenues in our Operations segment, Next Big Crop, which had increased revenues of 323% and 193%, respectively, for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same periods for 2016.&#194;&#160; As the number of states with regulated marijuana markets has increased, Next Big Crop has found a steady increase in demand for its services.</li>
<li data-reactid="16">Our Marketing segment, Chiefton, experienced 95% and 26%, respectively, increases in revenue during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 when compared to 2016.&#194;&#160; We added a new managing director in August 2017 to focus on our apparel business, which positively impacted revenues for both apparel sales and design revenue.</li>
<li data-reactid="17">Our Security segment, Iron Protection Group, experienced 11% and 16%, respectively, decreases in revenue during the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017, when compared to 2016.&#194;&#160; As previously discussed, IPG is impacted by the drop in wholesale cannabis prices in Colorado. &#194;&#160;In late August 2017, we acquired Mile High Protection Services, which provides us the opportunity to expand our security business into the non-cannabis space, as we believe that provides an opportunity for growth.&#194;&#160; We have also obtained our license to operate in California, and expect IPG to see significant growth in that market in 2018.</li>

<div id="leafly-dfp-ad-widget-mobile-medium-rectangle-779355103" class="leafly-dfp-ad-container">    </div>
<p>More than 60 percent of the more than 2,200 patients surveyed by the state report benefits from using marijuana in inhaled or pill forms during the first five months after Minnesota approved cannabis to treat pain. The survey also found that 43 percent of doctors observed medical marijuana having a positive effect on patients.</p>

<p>The report surveyed patients who used cannabis in 2016 for the first time to treat chronic pain.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s heartening to see that this fairly large proportion achieved that degree of reduction in their pain assessment score,&#8221; said Dr. Tom Arneson, research manager for the office of medical cannabis.</p>
<p>More than 350 patients involved in the study initially reported using opioid painkillers. Nearly 63 percent reported reduced or eliminated opioid usage after six months of using medical cannabis.</p>
<p>There were no reports of cannabis use that was life-threatening or required hospitalization.</p>

<p>Officials believe the results are encouraging, but say more research is necessary. A controlled study that includes giving some participants a placebo is needed, Arneson said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We need more research into the potential value of medical cannabis in pain management, especially as our communities grapple with the harmful impacts of opioids and other medications now in use for that purpose,&#8221; Arneson said.</p>
<p>About 10 percent of patients reported no benefit, while as much as 40 percent experienced mild side effects such as fogginess or fatigue. At least one patient found that the positive effects of cannabis were only temporary.</p>

<p>During a press conference on opioids at an Ohio inpatient facility that treats newborns suffering from prenatal drug exposure, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said, &#8220;There really is no such thing as medical <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a>&#8220;. The statement came on the heels of questions about the viability of medical cannabis as an alternative to opioid painkillers. So while Ohio is preparing to launch its legal medical cannabis program, Health Secretary Alex Azar denies existence of medical marijuana.</p>
<h2>Health Secretary Alex Azar Denies Existence Of Medical Marijuana</h2>
<p>Bridge&#8217;s Path is an inpatient facility in Kettering, Ohio. Physicians there treat newborns diagnosed with prenatal drug exposure. And increasingly, newborns are suffering from prenatal exposure to opioids.</p>
<p>Deaths from prescription and illicit opioid abuse have skyrocketed in recent years. Today, opioids are the <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/detroit-opioid-overdose-deaths-murders/">leading cause of death</a> for Americans under 50.</p>
<p>Last October, President Trump decried the opioid epidemic as a National Public Health Emergency. But critics <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/trump-finally-declares-opioid-epidemic-a-public-health-emergency/">blasted the move</a> as largely symbolic.</p>
<p>More recently, reports have surfaced that Trump frequently expresses a desire to <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/donald-trump-execution-drug-dealers/">execute every drug dealer in America</a>.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Those close to the president qualified his statements as meaning large-volume drug traffickers pedaling synthetic opioids like fentanyl.</p>
<p>During the press conference at Bridge&#8217;s Path, Trump&#8217;s health chief described the funding the government is devoting to combating the opioid crisis.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are devoting hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of research at our National Institutes of Health as part of the historic $13 billion opioid and serious mental illness program that the president and Congress are funding,&#8221; Azar <a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/national/such-thing-medical-marijuana-health-secretary-says/eZkOYR0zXTghh1seUvQPAI/" rel="nofollow">said</a>.</p>
<p>Azar went on to describe how &#8220;over $750 million just in 2019 alone is going to be dedicated towards the National Institutes of Health working in public-private partnership to try and develop the next generation of pain therapies that are not opioids.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Yet when asked what role he sees medical marijuana playing as a next-generation <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/rep-earl-blumenauer-testified-medical-marijuana-could-combat-the-opioid-epidemic/">alternative to opioids</a>, Azar had this to <a href="https://www.daytondailynews.com/news/local/such-thing-medical-marijuana-health-secretary-says-dayton/La8dTJgu6nF3ojSc1z6yPO/" rel="nofollow">say</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;There is no FDA-approved use of marijuana, a botanical plant. I just want to be very clear about that.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Alex Azar, Former Big Pharma Exec, Says Cannabis Has No Medical Value</h2>
<p>When Azar says there&#8217;s &#8220;is no FDA-approved&#8221; use of marijuana, he&#8217;s correct in a purely technical sense. Indeed, the federal government still considers marijuana a <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/pediatricians-demand-dea-reclassify-cannabis/">Schedule I drug</a>.</p>
<p>But that is not the same thing as saying &#8220;there really is no such thing as medical marijuana&#8221;.</p>
<p><a href="https://hightimes.com/health/science/cannabinoids-interact-pain-circuits/">Multiple studies</a> and countless patient testimonies provide a strong for the safety and effectiveness of cannabis as a pain reliever. At the very least, the data calls for further study, not outright dismissals.</p>
<p>But a quick survey of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_Azar" rel="nofollow">Alex Azar&#8217;s r&#233;sum&#233;</a> might reveal why the former Big Pharma executive is taking such a baffling stance against medical cannabis.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentC -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc article_middleContentC dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Azar represents exactly the kind of revolving door from lobbying firms to public office that Trump promised he would put an end to with his &#8220;drain the swamp&#8221; campaign platform.</p>
<p>Azar was US Deputy Secretary of Health and Human Services for George W. Bush before becoming President of Eli Lilly and Company, a major pharmaceutical firm, from 2012 to 2017.</p>
<p>During that time, Azar also served on the board of directors of the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, a large pharmaceutical lobby.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s safe to assume the &#8220;public-private&#8221; partnerships Azar mentioned in the Kettering press conference would benefit drug companies like Eli Lilly.</p>
<p>Multiple investigations have documented the <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/opioid-commission-argues-cannabis-legalization/">aggressive anti-cannabis lobbying</a> of the major pharmaceutical companies. Put simply, legal medical cannabis represents a <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/philadelphia-district-attorney-sues-big-pharma-opioid-crisis/">major threat to drug company profits</a> and their grip on the industry.</p>
<p>And Azar&#8217;s completely unfounded claim that there is no such thing as medical marijuana is a transparent indication of the conflicts of interest shaping federal drug policy and the government&#8217;s response to the opioid crisis.</p>
<h2>Former Big Pharma Lobbyist Turned Health Secretary Alex Azar Denies Existence Of Medical Marijuana</h2>
<p>So when Trump&#8217;s Health Secretary Alex Azar denies existence of medical marijuana, it&#8217;s not because he&#8217;s ignorant of the facts.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s because Azar is beholden to the special interests of Big Pharma, not the well-being of the American public.</p>

<p>California&#8217;s Bureau of Cannabis Control (BCC) has sent out more than 500 warning letters threatening legal action to unlicensed businesses. The letters were sent last week to retail dispensaries and delivery services who have not yet received licenses to operate under the state&#8217;s <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/california-releases-long-awaited-marijuana-regulations/">cannabis regulations</a> that went into effect on January 1. In the letters, California threatens hundreds of unlicensed cannabis businesses.</p>
<h2>A Formal Warning</h2>
<p>The letters, from Assistant Chief of Enforcement Paul Tupy, warn the businesses that the BCC believes they are participating in commercial <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> activity contrary to provisions of the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA). The letters also demand that <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/california-cracking-illegal-marijuana-businesses/">all such activity immediately cease</a>. Criminal and civil penalties are threatened if violations continue.</p>
<p>MAUCRSA was passed by the legislature in 2017 to reconcile differences in the state&#8217;s medical marijuana laws and Prop 64, which legalized marijuana for adult-use in California when it was passed by voters in 2016.</p>
<p>The BCC had previously indicated that enforcement of the new regulations would not begin immediately in 2018. But nearly two months into the new year, the agency and law enforcement have been receiving complaints about businesses who have not yet received licenses but are still operating. Many of those complaints&#160;are coming from the more than 3,000 companies who are operating legally after already completing the costly and laborious process of obtaining a license.</p>
<p>Natalia Thurston, a cannabis law attorney with a <a href="http://www.cbdpros.com/" rel="nofollow">practice</a> in Oakland, California, told&#160;<em>High Times</em> that one of her clients received warning emails from the BCC on February 14 and 20. The anonymous client operated a medical cannabis delivery service in the Bay Area but ceased operations January 1 when the new regulations went into effect.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Thurston noted that the emails did not indicate what her client has been accused of. &#8220;There was no evidence or specific factual information provided in the email notices regarding the activity alleged in the emails,&#8221; she said.</p>
<h2>Powerful Message</h2>
<p>It appears advertising by the targeted businesses may have instigated some of the warning&#160;letters. At a legislative hearing in Sacramento this week, Assemblymember Evan Low asked BCC Chair Lori Ajax about advertising appearing in a weekly newspaper. The ads, Low said, had missing or falsified license numbers.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a complete disregard and gross negligence of the law,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>According to Ajax, her agency was already aware of the issue, mentioning the warnings that had been recently sent out.</p>
<p>&#8220;We are already dedicating a lot of our enforcement staff just on advertising because it is that important,&#8221;&#160;Ajax said. &#8220;It is prevalent, not just in Sacramento but across the state and it is jeopardizing the regulated market. We want to get this right.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Ajax also said the letters sent a &#8220;powerful message&#8221; to unlicensed commercial cannabis operators.</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;California Threatens Hundreds of Unlicensed Cannabis Businesses</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s not yet clear how many businesses plan to heed the warnings. Attorney Thurston&#8217;s delivery service client won&#8217;t be back on the road until it obtains local and state licenses.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the text of the warning letter sent to hundreds of California cannabis businesses suspected of operating without a license.</p>

</div>
<p>The Bureau of Cannabis Control (Bureau) has reason to believe that you may be engaging in unlicensed commercial cannabis activity. Pursuant to the provisions of the Medicinal and Adult-Use Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act (MAUCRSA), a valid state license from a state licensing authority is required to legally operate a commercial cannabis business within the State of California. If you are in fact engaging in unlicensed commercial cannabis activity, you must cease all commercial cannabis operations until you obtain a valid state license to avoid further violations of state law. Please be aware that such violations may result in criminal and administrative penalties, as well as civil penalties totaling up to three times the amount of the license fee for each violation.</p>
<p>To apply for a license, please visit the Bureau&#8217;s website,&#160;<a href="http://www.bcc.ca.gov/" rel="nofollow">www.bcc.ca.gov</a>, or contact the Bureau at (833) 768-5880.</p>

<p>The strange, suspenseful saga of &#8216;Operation Candy Crush&#8217; has ended after charges were dropped by prosecutors. Rutherford County, Tennessee District Jennings J. Jones announced the decision in a press release February 28. Jones has filed a motion with the court to dismiss all charges.</p>
<p>Operation Candy Crush received national news attention last month. Deputies from the Rutherford County Sherrif&#8217;s Office raided&#160;23 stores in the county on February 12. Deputies seized cash, gummy <a href="https://hightimes.com/edibles/best-edibles-2017/">candies</a>, and <a href="https://hightimes.com/products/best-portable-vaporizers-2017/">vape cartridges</a> containing the cannabinoid <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/cannabidiol-cbd/">CBD</a> in the raids. Officers padlocked the stores, and they remained closed for four days. The DA&#8217;s office had filed petitions to declare the businesses public nuisances and closed permanently.</p>
<p>Officials also charged 21 store owners with felony drug selling charges. Jones dropped the charges after labs at the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI) reported that they could not determine the source of the CBD. The DA ended the actions against the stores, as well.</p>
<h2>Is It Hemp? Or Marijuana?</h2>
<p>&#8220;Chemists from the TBI have now informed my office that they cannot determine whether the cannabidiol detected on these products came from a hemp plant or marijuana plant,&#8221; the release said.</p>
<p>&#8220;TBI is no longer willing to testify that this is a Schedule VI substance. We have no choice but to dismiss,&#8221; Jones <a href="http://www.dnj.com/story/news/crime/2018/02/28/operation-candy-crush-charges-dropped-cbd-raid-industrial-hemp/372793002/" rel="nofollow">told local media</a>.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>Originally, Jones expressed great confidence in the case.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you possess this without a prescription, you have broken the law,&#8221; Jones said at a press conference after the raids.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you are selling this without a prescription or if you&#8217;re not a pharmacy selling it to someone with a prescription for it, you have broken the law.&#8221;</p>
<p>Farmers can legally grow hemp in Tennessee under a state pilot program.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>Insult to Injury</h2>
<p>In another twist in the case, authorities could be held responsible for losses at one of the stores. A thief broke into the Last Stop Market during the time it was under order to remain closed.</p>
<p>Store clerk Jacklyn Ryder <a href="http://wkrn.com/2018/02/26/rutherford-county-store-raided-in-operation-candy-crush-broken-into-while-padlocked/" rel="nofollow">told a local TV news station</a> she was working when the store was raided. Deputies denied her request to set the store&#8217;s alarm before they left, she says.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our store was left unalarmed for four days while we were closed down because of this,&#8221; said Ryder.</p>
<p>The thief&#160;stole more than $600 from a change machine and some beer. The burglar pried open the store&#8217;s back door to gain entry. The door received extensive damage in the break-in. She said the store&#8217;s owner may file suit, a sentiment she agrees with.</p>
<p>&#8220;I feel not only him. I feel like every store that suffered should file a lawsuit because they have families too,&#8221; Ryder said. &#8220;I went four days, that&#8217;s about $400 out of my check that I don&#8217;t have because of some allegation that&#8217;s not true.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;The Strange, Suspenseful Saga of &#8216;Operation Candy Crush&#8217; Has Ended</h2>
<p>Other store owners say that they are also planning a civil suit in response to the raids and store closures. Throughout their ordeal, the businesspeople had stuck together, pledging not to plea bargain.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has caused an enormous cost to all the store owners,&#8221; store owner Stacey Hamilton said. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll apologize in nearly as public a way as they condemned us as drug dealers.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<p>&#8220;To them it&#8217;s competition for chronic pain, and that&#8217;s outrageous because we don&#8217;t have the crisis in people who take marijuana for chronic pain having overdose issues,&#8221; Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York said. &#8220;It&#8217;s not the same thing. It&#8217;s not as highly addictive as opioids are.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;On the federal level, we really need to say it is a legal drug you can access if you need it,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>Gillibrand, in an appearance on Good Day New York on Friday morning, was responding to a question about whether marijuana is a &#8220;gateway drug&#8221; that leads people to try more dangerous substances.</p>

											    	<h4>When the lack-of-weed blues gets you down, swiftly make your way back to a state where cannabis is legal.</h4>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think you should bring your vape pen on the plane,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p><em>Fine, I will respect your wishes and not get your sober self into trouble with TSA for carrying hash oil,</em> I thought to myself. Already reticent about a weekend away on someone else&#8217;s accord, I wasn&#8217;t sure if this trip was a good move.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry,&#8221; my boss mentioned, &#8220;You will love it; there are <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/hippie-time-flower-power-quiz/" data-wpel-link="internal">hippies</a> in Austin, Texas.&#8221;</p>
<h4>Where there are hippies, there&#8217;s weed?</h4>
<p>The parental unit will provide the stash, he tried to soothe me. &#8220;Like the jar they gave me for Christmas?&#8221; I asked. &#8220;They used to grow better weed when I was a kid.&#8221; Oh, nostalgia. I took his word for it.</p>
<h4>Here&#8217;s ten ways quality weed would have elevated my weekend in Texas:</h4>
<ul>
<li>I would have consumed a heavy Indica and snoozed through the red-eye flight to <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/texas-compassionate-use-act-cbd/" data-wpel-link="internal">Austin</a>.</li>
<li>Early that morning when we rolled in, a Sativa would have propelled me on the drive to visit the parents in San Antonio.</li>
<li>Cannabis tea would have aided me in digesting an accidental gluten intake.</li>
<li>When stuck in the apartment with my feverish child, I would have thought of some clever way of getting to know Austin without having to leave the pad. I could have brought Austin to me by smoking with the neighbors and getting to know the locals.</li>
<li>Had I been high at the wedding, I would have schmoozed with the wedding guests and likely convinced a local politician to <a href="http://www.dallasobserver.com/news/texas-marijuana-laws-in-2018-and-beyond-10201247" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">legalize it</a>.</li>
<li>I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten a headache from mixing tequila and red wine. Instead, I would have gotten the munchies from mixing Indica and Sativa.</li>
<li>The spelunking would have been even more DOPE!</li>
<li>Cannabis-infused southern sweet tea, that is all.</li>
<li>Instead of bawling my eyes out to him in the hot tub, we would have had stoned sexy times under a full moon.</li>
<li>I would have blown smoke at the bugs preventing them from attacking my shoulder.</li>
</ul>
<p>But cannabis is <a href="https://www.mpp.org/states/texas/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">not legal</a> in the state of <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/12/18/texas-medical-marijuana-law-rules/94818/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">Texas</a>. And year-old pre-crumbled <a href="https://www.dopemagazine.com/kelly-guava-jelly-hippie-musings/" data-wpel-link="internal">hippie</a> weed from eastern Washington just didn&#8217;t cut it for me.</p>
<p>Vacations are better with your best friend Mary Jane. With weed as the herb of your life, you can always find the right blend to get the sensation right.</p>

<h4>Vape Cartridges by Pride Wellness</h4>
<p>Pride Cannabis is now Pride Wellness&#8212;the same products you love, just with a more fitting name. For the owners, the name change was a no-brainer. &#8220;Our company is a wellness company; it makes more sense,&#8221; explains Co-Owner Buck Angel. &#8220;It&#8217;s very important that people understand why we started Pride Wellness. We realize our community does suffer from a lot of abuse of drugs and alcohol, as well as anxiety. Nobody is really targeting our community for wellness with cannabis. That&#8217;s why we started it&#8212;to really help people to understand they can use alternative medication like cannabis, instead of pharmaceuticals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sugar&#8221; Sean O&#8217;Malley made his much-anticipated&#160;debut at UFC 222 on Saturday night, and despite an impressive victory, his exploits in the octagon weren&#8217;t the only highlights of the night. One of the more noteworthy moments of the 23-year-old&#8217;s night actually came after the much-anticipated event, when O&#8217;Malley got the chance to show off his custom new weed strain at the UFC 222 after-party.</p>
<h2>Sean O&#8217;Malley&#8217;s Strain</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s no coincidence that Sean O&#8217;Malley happens to <a href="https://hightimes.com/business/snoop-dogg-joins-cannabis-lab-testing-game/">Snoop Dogg&#8217;s</a> favorite new fighter.</p>
<p>The fighter first made a name for himself back in July with a one-punch knockout of&#160;Alfred Khashakyan on &#8220;Dana White&#8217;s Tuesday Night Contender Series.&#8221;</p>
<p>He later celebrated by<a href="http://www.tmz.com/2017/07/21/snoop-dogg-ufc-sean-omalley/" rel="nofollow"> smoking up with Snoop</a>.</p>
<p>Fast forward eight months and the fighter is now making waves in both the UFC and amongst the <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> community.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>Despite injuring his foot in the third round of his debut fight with fellow bantamweight&#160;Andre Soukhamthath, O&#8217;Malley managed to cruise to a victory with a dominating performance.</p>
<p>Following the gutsy win, the now-undefeated fighter used some of his own herbal remedies to facilitate a recovery.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Malley was, unsurprisingly, seen toking up through a&#160;golden glove spliff some time after the event, with what we presume to be the strain he said he would debut following the contest.</p>
<p>The customized bud is, according to O&#8217;Malley, a hybrid between Lemonhead and OG92.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re releasing the new strain, Suga Show OG,&#8221; O&#8217;Malley said in an interview with&#160;<a href="http://www.tmz.com/2018/03/01/sean-omalley-custom-weed-strain-ufc-222-sugar-show/" rel="nofollow">TMZ Sports</a>&#160;earlier in the week.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mix between Lemonhead and OG 92. I think they&#8217;re going to bring a good amount of that. They&#8217;re gonna have dab rigs set up. We&#8217;re gonna have a juice bar. The ultimate recovery: Smoking some weed and drinking some veggies.&#8221;</p>
<p>While UFC president Dana White confirmed Saturday night that O&#8217;Malley did not suffer a broken foot in his contest, there&#8217;s no doubt Suga Show OG won&#8217;t help it&#8217;s creator throughout the recovery process, nonetheless.</p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;Sean O&#8217;Malley Shows Off His New Weed Strain At UFC 222 After-Party</h2>
<p>While some might be surprised at the young gun&#8217;s willingness to show off his toking habits in his first professional fight, it shouldn&#8217;t come as that much of a shock to those who closely follow the UFC.</p>
<p>The UFC remains one of the more progressive sporting leagues when it comes to smoking weed, as it essentially allows its players to smoke&#8212;as long as it&#8217;s not right before a fight.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, we&#8217;ve seen it&#8217;s biggest star, <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/ufc-champion-conor-mcgregor-spotted-amsterdam-weed-cafe/">Conor McGregor, checking out an Amsterdam dispensary in plain sight</a>.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentC -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc article_middleContentC dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>More telling, however, has been the <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/nate-diaz-sparks-joint-on-live-tv/">Diaz brothers</a> and their lust for cannabis. A few weeks back, we saw Nate Diaz smoke a joint on live television.</p>
<p>Although the younger Diaz brother has been suspended for his weed usage in the past, it appears&#160;he could be eyeing a comeback. With today&#8217;s lax rules, we could see him in the octagon sooner, rather than later.</p>
<p>After all, it&#8217;s not like his older brother, Nick, has been secretive <a href="https://hightimes.com/sports/high-times-interview-nick-diaz/">about his own cannabis usage</a>, either.</p>
<p>So in what appears to be the first major sporting league to embrace the plant&#8217;s medicinal qualities, the talented Sean O&#8217;Malley appears to have a place in the UFC&#8212;both in and out of the octagon.</p>

When I grab a vape pen and hold it to my lips and it goes off like a Sonicare possessed, I&#8217;m forced to ask myself, &#8220;Is this enhancing my cannabis consuming experience?&#8221; And if so, why?<br>
</p>

<p>To find out, I recently put the <a href="https://www.leafly.com/brands/indigopro">IndigoPro&#8217;s Advanced Vapor System</a> to the test. This new proprietary cartridge system boasts three times the vapor&#8230;but does that mean it goes through oil three times as fast?</p>
<h2>The IndigoPro at a Glance</h2>
<figure id="attachment_59286" style="width: 840px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-59286 size-large" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090334/indigo-pro-2-1024x640.jpg" alt="IndigoPro weed oil vape pen box contents" width="840" height="525" srcset="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090334/indigo-pro-2-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090334/indigo-pro-2-300x188.jpg 300w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090334/indigo-pro-2-768x480.jpg 768w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090334/indigo-pro-2-50x31.jpg 50w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090334/indigo-pro-2-1280x800.jpg 1280w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090334/indigo-pro-2-960x600.jpg 960w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090334/indigo-pro-2-480x300.jpg 480w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090334/indigo-pro-2-240x150.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(Julia Sumpter/Leafly)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The IndigoPro includes a minimalist carrying case with a foam cutout for the battery and a library of IndigoPro cartridges. Its battery is 320mAh, which is about 40mAh higher than standard variable voltage batteries. (Think of milliampere hours, or mAh, as the size of your battery&#8217;s fuel tank.) The unit comes in indigo (naturally) and graphite colors, and has a beautiful octagonal finish that is sleek and buttonless.</p>

<p>Included with the case is a micro-USB charging cable to get you up and running. There isn&#8217;t a logical place to put this cord in the provided case, which seems like a missed opportunity, but IndigoPro still has a few design tricks up its sleeve.</p>
<h2>What Does the IndigoPro Do Well?</h2>

<p>After getting acquainted with the IndigoPro, I&#8217;ve come to appreciate some a few aspects of its design and functionality.</p>
<h3>Heavy Hits</h3>
<p>The IndigoPro&#8217;s draws are airy but firm, accompanied by the aforementioned mouth vibration. I don&#8217;t know whether or not it&#8217;s three times the vapor, but I find myself coughing more because the hits are so large. These voluminous hits definitely get me lifted.</p>
<h3>Impressive, Function-Forward Tech</h3>
<p>While the high is the part of the cannabis-consuming experience that stays with you, the technology powering the IndigoPro experience shines as well. Its use of USB charging, for example, is a must for all future vaporizers&#8212;USB technology is so ubiquitous nowadays, it&#8217;s practically a no-brainer when designing a highly functional, easy-to-use vape pen.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/science-tech/fascinating-uses-of-technology-in-cannabis-industry"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/03094230/technology-cannabis-industry-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">4 Fascinating Uses of Technology in the Cannabis Industry</div></div></a></div>
<p>Another unique technical feature is how the unit&#8217;s vibration is used as a battery indicator. While the vibration may seem like a bit of a novelty, embedding functional elements like this shows some design foresight&#8212;removing buttons eliminates the anxiety of accidentally turning on the vape pen in a pocket or depressing a button and cooking the cart oil off while walking or sitting down. It&#8217;s an aesthetic win as well, keeping all the solid lines on the body of the unit intact to give the battery its sleek, clean exterior.</p>
<h3>Simple Cartridge Design</h3>
<p>Speaking of design, IndigoPro&#8217;s cartridges are conveniently color-coded to help jog a consumer&#8217;s memory, but this method can get challenging the more a person buys into the IndigoPro Advanced Vapor System. For example, if I&#8217;m an indica-only type of dude and have all purple-tipped carts, how do I figure out which strain is which? This hurdle aside, the coloration is beautiful and representative, which can be a guide post for the average consumer.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/sativa-indica-and-hybrid-differences-between-cannabis-types"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/26114231/Sativa-vs-Indica-Header-1-480x300.png"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Sativa vs. Indica vs. Hybrid: What&#8217;s the Difference Between Cannabis Types?</div></div></a></div>
<p>Unfortunately, cartridge availability is a bit of an issue depending on the market you&#8217;re in. IndigoPro&#8217;s CO2 cartridges with natural, cannabis-derived <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/terpenes-the-flavors-of-cannabis-aromatherapy">terpenes</a> are available in some locations, but not in Seattle (where I live). It&#8217;s a bummer that these cartridges are out of reach in my area,&#160; but I am glad to hear that consumers have choices within IndigoPro&#8217;s proprietary cartridge ecosystem.</p>
<h2>Where Could the IndigoPro Improve?</h2>
<figure id="attachment_59287" style="width: 840px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="wp-image-59287 size-large" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090343/indigo-pro-4-1024x640.jpg" alt="IndigoPro weed oil vape pen battery" width="840" height="525" srcset="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090343/indigo-pro-4-1024x640.jpg 1024w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090343/indigo-pro-4-300x188.jpg 300w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090343/indigo-pro-4-768x480.jpg 768w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090343/indigo-pro-4-50x31.jpg 50w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090343/indigo-pro-4-1280x800.jpg 1280w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090343/indigo-pro-4-960x600.jpg 960w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090343/indigo-pro-4-480x300.jpg 480w, https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/01090343/indigo-pro-4-240x150.jpg 240w" sizes="(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">(Julia Sumpter/Leafly)</figcaption></figure>
<p>As slick as the IndigoPro is from a design and tech perspective, there are some areas of improvement.</p>
<h3>Proprietary Cartridges Can Be Too Limiting</h3>
<p>The pen uses a proprietary magnetized cartridge that does not fit with any other vape pen. While IndigoPro boasts &#8220;magnetic, leak-resistant ceramic cartridges,&#8221; I&#8217;m frustrated by the technical limitations just so the cart can vibrate and magnetically attach to the battery. These design flourishes look and feel good the first couple of times using the unit, but the novelty does not outweigh its limitation.</p>
<h3>No Cartridge Labeling</h3>
<p>As I mentioned, another frustrating drawback is the lack of labeling on the cartridges. This problem has only recently been addressed by <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/pax-era-portable-cannabis-oil-vaporizer-review">Pax and its Pax Pods</a>, but as a cartridge consumer with carts for different occasions, labeling is almost priceless.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/strains-products/pax-era-portable-cannabis-oil-vaporizer-review"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/25100331/pax-era-review-1-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">The PAX Era Ushers in a New Generation of Cannabis Cartridge Technology</div></div></a></div>
<h3>Potential Vapor Waste</h3>
<p>IndigoPro cartridges are as expensive, if not more expensive, than your standard cart, and it&#8217;s nice that they create a lot of vapor, but from a consumer standpoint, that could also mean a lot of waste. Even with a standard vape cartridge, I&#8217;m not holding each hit so long that I exhale nothing. With each hit I leisurely exhale the vapor (and <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/cannabis-101/cannabinoids-101-what-makes-cannabis-medicine">cannabinoids</a>) that didn&#8217;t get absorbed in my lungs. Force-feeding a bunch of vapor into someone&#8217;s lungs might please consumers looking for fat clouds, but it doesn&#8217;t make a dollar&#8217;s worth of cents to go puffing cannabinoids you&#8217;re inevitably wasting.</p>
<h3>Flavor Concerns</h3>
<p>While the the cartridges have a fancy design and novel function, the contents of the cartridge is really where the story&#8217;s at. <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/science-tech/what-are-cannabis-distillate-concentrates">Distillate</a>, as many cannabis consumers know, is a potent, mostly flavorless concentration of a strain&#8217;s primary cannabinoids. Because distillate is almost entirely flavorless, many companies see this as a blank slate to create new and intriguing flavors through the introduction of botanical oils that don&#8217;t originate from the cannabis plant.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/science-tech/what-are-cannabis-distillate-concentrates"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/30143132/cannabis-distillate-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Cannabis Oil Distillate: A Different Kind of Concentrate</div></div></a></div>
<p>While some consumers don&#8217;t mind the artificial taste of these botanical elements and are just stoked on the high-octane punch of distillate, consumers like myself can find the flavor to be off-putting. These distillates are also sold as strain-specific, even though they contain little to no cannabis-derived terpenes that truly define a strain&#8217;s flavor, effects, and overall uniqueness.</p>
<h2>Who Is the IndigoPro For?</h2>
<p>In my opinion, the IndigoPro is for heavy-hitting vape consumers looking for massive pulls of potent concentrate. If you&#8217;re not a big fan of the way cannabis tastes and you&#8217;d rather have a flavor-injected experience with sugar plum, blackberry, or whatever your preferred characteristic may be, the IndigoPro might be right up your alley.</p>
<p>Truth be told, the IndigoPro isn&#8217;t the device for me. The mouth vibrations and magnetic mouthpieces just weren&#8217;t enough for me to invest in a whole new cartridge ecosystem. Other consumers might have different feelings, however, and I encourage them to share their opinion&#8212;what do you think about the IndigoPro?</p>

<div class="leafly-pull-quote">On some shows, cannabis isn&#8217;t merely an accessory, but a device that kicks the plot&#8217;s gears into motion.</div>
<p>For decades, the plant has enjoyed winking cameos in film and TV. Before <em>Weeds</em>, <em>Broad City</em> and <em>High Maintenance</em>, films like <em>Easy Rider</em> glorified the mind-expanding effects of cannabis, while Cheech &amp; Chong pioneered new strains of stoner humor.</p>
<p>Today, it&#8217;s often granted a starring role: when Abbi or Ilana light up yet another <a href="http://www.thecannabist.co/2016/03/17/broad-city-weed-ilana-glazer-abbi-jacobson/50292/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fake blunt</a> on camera, the herb isn&#8217;t serving as a mere accessory, but as a device that kicks the plot&#8217;s gears into motion.</p>
<h2>Let the Ideas Flow</h2>
<p>Cannabis has a long-honored place behind the camera as well. Hollywood traditionally maintains a hands-off approach towards its cannabis-friendly creatives: In 2014, <a href="http://drugs.gawker.com/8-big-media-companies-that-still-drug-test-their-employ-1599105435" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gawker discovered</a> that 17 media companies drug-tested their employees&#8212;including Gannett, Hearst, The Washington Post and the New York Times&#8212;but testing is almost nonexistent within the creative ranks of TV shows and films. According to one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FilmIndustryLA/comments/4sdrlo/employees_of_large_entertainment_companies_nbc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anonymous Reddit thread</a>, you can spend an entire career hopping from studio to studio without ever having to pee into a cup, even at Disney.</p>
<p>The one exception is in reality TV, where &#8220;personalities&#8221; are often tested during the casting process. &#8221;If it&#8217;s weed, we don&#8217;t care,&#8221; says Jeffrey Marx, a reality TV casting associate. &#8220;We just check because we want to know what to expect while we&#8217;re filming.&#8221;</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">''I&#8217;ve never been tested,'' one former showrunner told Leafly. ''Why would employers try to stop something that aids in creativity and makes them money?''</div>
<p>A few years ago, when Leonardo DiCaprio showed up at awards ceremonies with a vape pen, it was taken as a bold, if not shocking, move. Now vape pens are ubiquitous at award shows and other industry events. Sarah Silverman showed hers off at the Emmys a few years back and <a href="http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/gossip/la-et-mg-sarah-silverman-pot-vape-pen-emmy-awards-red-carpet-20140826-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no one batted an eye.&#160; </a></p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been tested,&#8221; one former showrunner, who wished to remain anonymous, told Leafly. &#8220;Why would employers try to stop something that aids in creativity and makes them money?&#8221;</p>
<p>In the 1990s, the showrunner added, her employers held an even more permissive view of the drug. &#8220;I used to openly smoke in my office and sometimes in after-hour creative sessions. I remember one meeting for a TV special where nothing was happening so I pulled out a joint. Nobody cared.&#8221;</p>
<p>But as the studios she worked for were gobbled up by international corporations&#8212;and came within the purview of mainstream HR departments&#8212;the laissez-faire attitudes diminished. &#8220;Everyone became more uptight,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Ironically, though, not about sexual misconduct.&#8221;</p>

<h2>The Writers Prefer Sativas</h2>
<p>Guy Branum, a story editor on <em>The Mindy Project</em> and host of <em>Talk Show The Game Show</em>, told Leafly that most shows don&#8217;t care who vapes during breaks. The atmosphere, of course, depends heavily on the discretion of showrunners, studios and networks. One critically acclaimed show, Branum added, is known to share a bong in the writers&#8217; room.</p>
<p>As for strains, Branum says that any energizing, creative sativa is a favorite among his crew. Indicas, he added, were strictly for &#8220;open mic&#8217;ers with no jobs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Not everyone in the industry has enjoyed the fruits of marijuana&#8217;s growing acceptance. Another writer, who wished to remain anonymous, said the idea of smoking in a writer&#8217;s room on his show is a nonstarter. &#8220;I feel like people realized that didn&#8217;t work in the seventies. I don&#8217;t even know if stoned ideas are very good, to be honest.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Coming Out as Consumers and Creators</h2>
<p><a href="http://cherylshuman.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cheryl Shuman</a>, founder of the Beverly Hills Cannabis Club, has been organizing events for Hollywood stoners since the early nineties. She told Leafly that industry players have become increasingly comfortable coming out of the &#8220;green closet.&#8221;</p>
<div class="leafly-pull-quote">Back in the 1990s, some cannabis-consuming actors working on the same set wouldn''t dare talk about it with each other.</div>
<p>&#8220;When I first got involved with legalization in the late nineties, I received calls from very famous people and they&#8217;d say, &#8216;I&#8217;ve been a closet smoker for so long; can you help me get legal and teach me how to have my own little garden in the backyard?&#8217; Some of these people were actors working on the same movie set together but wouldn&#8217;t dare talk about it with their co-stars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Shuman, who refers to herself as &#8216;the Martha Stewart of marijuana,&#8217; happily offered her assistance. She began throwing speakeasy parties and passing out samples of different strains to her friends. &#8220;Around 1996 and 1997, we&#8217;d bring fresh product down and I&#8217;d have almost a thousand people over. We did yoga retreats and we&#8217;d fly people up to where I grew pot. Nobody knows this stuff. I can tell it now; back then, I couldn&#8217;t tell anybody.&#8221;</p>
<p>Miriam Hess, who works as an animation writer, says she&#8217;s surprised more of her coworkers don&#8217;t partake in the stuff. &#8220;The animation world is more corporate and a lot of times people don&#8217;t want to talk about it openly,&#8221; she says. &#8220;Then again, many of my coworkers are sharp-tongued and brazen, so maybe they don&#8217;t need the weed. Maybe it slows them down, in a way, because some of them have this manic thing going on, which is kind of the stereotype of the L.A. male Hollywood writer.&#8221;</p>

<p>More than 60 percent of the more than 2,200 patients surveyed by the state report benefits from using marijuana in inhaled or pill forms during the first five months after Minnesota approved cannabis to treat pain.</p>
<p>The report surveyed patients who used cannabis in 2016 for the first time to treat chronic pain.</p>

<p>More than 350 patients involved in the study initially reported using opioid painkillers. Nearly 63 percent reported reduced or eliminated opioid usage after six months of using medical cannabis.</p>
<p>Officials believe the results are encouraging, but say more research is necessary.</p>
<p>About 10 percent of patients reported no benefit, while as much as 40 percent experienced mild side effects such as fogginess or fatigue.</p>

The result is the slow decline of pre-employment drug tests, which for decades had been a requirement for new recruits in industries ranging from manufacturing to finance.</p>
<p>As of the beginning of 2018, Excellence Health Inc., a Las Vegas-based health care company with around 6,000 employees, no longer drug tests people coming to work for the pharmaceutical side of the business. The company stopped testing for marijuana two years ago. &#8220;We don&#8217;t care what people do in their free time,&#8221; said Liam Meyer, a company spokesperson. &#8220;We want to help these people, instead of saying: &#8216;Hey, you can&#8217;t work for us because you used a substance,''&#8221; he added. The company also added a hotline for any workers who might be struggling with drug use.&#8217;</p>
<p>Last month, AutoNation Inc., the largest U.S. auto dealer, <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/29/auto-nation-marijuana-test-hiring-policy/97765/">announced it would no longer refuse job applicants who tested positive for weed</a>. The Denver Post, owned by Digital First Media, ended pre-employment drug testing for all non-safety sensitive positions in September 2016.</p>
<p>So far, companies in states that have legalized either recreational or medicinal marijuana are leading the way on dropping drug tests. A survey last year by the Mountain States Employers Council of 609 Colorado employers found that the share of companies testing for marijuana use fell to 66 percent, down from 77 percent the year before.</p>

<hr>
<p>Drug testing <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/07/31/drug-test-marijuana-workers/84887/">restricts the job pool</a>, and in the current tight labor market, that&#8217;s having an impact on productivity and growth.</p>
<p>In surveys done by the Federal Reserve last year, employers cited an inability by applicants to pass drug tests among reasons for difficulties in hiring. Failed tests reached an all-time high in 2017, according to data from Quest Diagnostics Inc.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s likely to get worse as more people partake in state-legalized cannabis.</p>
<p>&#8220;The benefits of at least reconsidering the drug policy on behalf of an employer would be pretty high,&#8221; said Jeremy Kidd, a professor at Mercer Law School, who wrote a paper on the economics of workplace drug testing. &#8220;A blanket prohibition can&#8217;t possibly be the most economically efficient policy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Companies are having a hard enough time hiring, with unemployment hovering around 4 percent. &#8220;Employers are really strapped and saying &#8216;We&#8217;re going to forgive certain things,''&#8221; said James Reidy, a lawyer that works with employers on their human resources policies. Reidy knows of a half-dozen other large employers that have quietly changed their policies in recent years. Not all companies want to advertise the change, fearing it might imply they are soft on drugs. (Even former FBI director James Comey in 2014 <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2014/06/02/should-getting-high-stop-you-from-getting-hired/12910/">half-joked about the need for the bureau to re-evaluate its drug-testing policy</a> to attract the best candidates.)</p>

<p>Why the change? Pre-employment testing is no longer worth the expense in a society increasingly accepting of drug use. A Gallup poll in October found that <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/10/25/gallup-poll-marijuana-legalization-americans/90851/">64 percent of Americans favor legalization</a>. That&#8217;s the most since the company first started asking the question in 1969, when only 12 percent supported changing the plant&#8217;s status. Drug tests costs from $30 to $50 a pop, but the potential costs to an employer are far greater than the actual test.</p>
<p>In addition to helping ease the labor market, eliminating drug testing could have even broader benefits for the economy, said Kidd. Employers could hire the best, theoretically most-productive workers, he said, instead of rejecting people based on their recreational habits. Companies have said they lose out to foreign competitors because they can&#8217;t find people who can pass drugs tests, a particularly acute problem in the areas most affected by the opioid crisis.</p>
<p>Some jobs, such as those involving the use of heavy machinery, will always require drug tests. Excellence Health still drug-tests any employee working on a government contract, even in states where weed is legal. Companies are also reserving the right to test after an accident or if an employee comes to work notably impaired.</p>
<p>Not all companies are ready to change course. Restaurant Brands International Inc., which owns Burger King, hasn&#8217;t altered its corporate marijuana policy, said Chief Executive Officer Daniel Schwartz. Ford Motor Co. still treats pot as an illegal substance, according to a company spokeswoman.</p>
<p>Weed-averse employers have a notable ally: <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/tag/jeff-sessions/">Attorney General Jeff Sessions</a>. A longtime opponent of legalization, Sessions <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/04/jeff-sessions-rescinding-legalized-marijuana-policy/95875/">rescinded in January</a> the Obama-era policies that enabled state-legalized cannabis industries to flourish. The <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/04/sessions-cole-memo-marijuana-legal-impact/95903/">uncertainty</a> caused by the Justice Department&#8217;s actions may discourage companies from making changes.</p>
<p>Employers can also get discounts on workers&#8217; compensation insurance for maintaining a &#8220;drug-free workplace&#8221; by, in part, drug-testing workers. But the types of workplaces forgoing pre-employment tests already enjoy relatively small savings. A job in an office setting, for example, won&#8217;t have very many workers&#8217; compensation claims, compared to a factory. The money saved by meeting the qualifications for a drug-free zone isn&#8217;t worth it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We assume that a certain level of employees are going to be partaking on the weekends,&#8221; said Reidy, the employment lawyer. &#8220;We don&#8217;t care. We&#8217;re going to exclude a whole group of people, and we desperately need workers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just hours after<a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/04/jeff-sessions-rescinding-legalized-marijuana-policy/95875/"> U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on Jan. 4 </a>that federal prosecutors would be free to crack down on marijuana operations as they see fit, Jesse Arreguin, the mayor in Berkeley, California, summoned city councilman Ben Bartlett to his office with a novel idea.</p>
<p>Berkeley was already the first city in the nation to formally declare itself a sanctuary city on immigration, barring city officials from cooperating with federal authorities. Why not do the same thing with marijuana? <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/02/14/marijuana-sanctuary-city-berkeley-sessions/99022/">Last month, it did</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew we had to do something,&#8221; Bartlett said. &#8220;This is a new engine of a healthy economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others may soon follow Berkeley&#8217;s lead: Alaska, California and Massachusetts lawmakers are among those with similar bills pending, though the chances for passage is unclear.</p>
<p>Alaska state Rep. Adam Wool, who owns a movie, restaurant and concert venue with a liquor license in <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/tag/fairbanks/">Fairbanks</a>, said he introduced his bill as both a statement and a precaution.</p>
<div class="large-6 medium-12 small-12 columns right sidebox related"><hr><h4>Related stories</h4><ul><li><a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/03/02/alaska-marijuana-taxes-january/100332/" rel="bookmark" title="Alaska marijuana tax collections hit new high in January">Alaska marijuana tax collections hit new high in January</a></li><li><a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/02/02/alaska-marijuana-tax-collections-tumble/98143/" rel="bookmark" title="Marijuana sales in Alaska drop for second month in a row">Marijuana sales in Alaska drop for second month in a row</a></li><li><a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/03/alaska-marijuana-sales-november/95817/" rel="bookmark" title="Alaska&#8217;s marijuana sales were down in November">Alaska&#8217;s marijuana sales were down in November</a></li></ul><hr></div>
<p>&#8220;If the federal government wants to prosecute someone for breaking federal law, I guess they have every right to do that,&#8221; said Wool, a Democrat from one of Alaska&#8217;s major marijuana-growing areas.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just saying, we will have no obligation to assist them.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/04/jeff-sessions-rescinding-legalized-marijuana-policy/95875/">Sessions&#8217; announcement</a> invalidated a 2013 policy that allowed for legalized marijuana to flourish by limiting federal enforcement of the drug, as long as states prevented it from getting to places it was outlawed and kept it from gangs and children. His action also <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/04/sessions-cole-memo-marijuana-legal-impact/95903/">unsettled the industry</a> and spooked potential marijuana industry investors. Marijuana is still illegal under federal law.</p>
<p>Casey O&#8217;Neill remembers helicopter enforcement raids of grow sites in California when he was growing up in the 1980s. It was then that his parents, carpenters who grew small amounts of cannabis, became school teachers, he said.</p>
<p>He now helps run a farm that produces vegetables and marijuana for medical use near Laytonville, </p>
<p>California, and is glad lawmakers are looking at ways to push back against the federal government.</p>
<p>Over the years, enforcement &#8220;has been uneven, we&#8217;ll say, and that&#8217;s kind of one of the things about it. It just means that everybody&#8217;s always afraid, and that&#8217;s hard,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Dale Gieringer, director of California NORML, a marijuana advocacy group, said California has a lousy history with the federal government on marijuana enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the feds care too much about marijuana in Alaska, to tell you the truth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But marijuana has been a big industry in this state, so we&#8217;re sort of on the front lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>There&#8217;s no apparent panic in the industry over Sessions&#8217; change in policy, given limited federal resources and prosecutors having had <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/05/prosecutors-pot-friendly-states-will-decide-crackdown/96164/">discretion in bringing cases all along</a>. But there isn&#8217;t complacency, either.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the federal government is going to effectively step in and wipe us out of business. </p>
<p>I just find that hard to believe at this point. But they can make it hard for us,&#8221; said Jennifer Canfield, who co-owns a state-licensed marijuana cultivation operation and retail store in Alaska&#8217;s capital city, Juneau.</p>
<p>Peter Mlynarik, police chief in Soldotna, Alaska, called the Alaska bill a terrible idea. He asked what would happen if a local agency were helping the federal government on a heroin bust but also found marijuana in the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s crazy to put that burden on, especially, police officers that are supposed to obey federal laws,&#8221; said Mlynarik, who <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/05/alaska-marijuana-control-board-mlynarik-sessions/96068/">resigned from Alaska&#8217;s marijuana regulatory board</a> after Sessions&#8217; actions in January, saying it stripped the underpinning for the state&#8217;s legal marijuana industry.</p>
<p>Morgan Fox, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, said he can&#8217;t see federal agents raiding businesses that are complying with state law.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t put it past them,&#8221; he said, adding that <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/02/05/sessions-marijuana-cole-memo-us-attorney/97703/">new U.S. attorneys have been appointed by President Donald Trump in many states</a>. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t put it past at least a few of them to want to gain points with their boss. But I think, politically, it would be a disaster for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Massachusetts&#8217; sanctuary-style bill was prompted by comments from that state&#8217;s U.S. attorney, Andrew Lelling, who <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/08/massachusetts-marijuana-law-prosecution-andrew-lelling/96249/">declined to rule out prosecuting commercial marijuana businesses</a> that are legal under state law. He later said his priority would be <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/24/massachusetts-marijuana-us-attorney-andrew-lelling/97474/">prosecuting opioid crimes, not marijuana</a>.</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam declined comment on the pending bills.</p>

</p>
<div id="leafly-dfp-ad-widget-mobile-medium-rectangle-281816461" class="leafly-dfp-ad-container">    </div>
<p>The conviction came after Michael Kimbrew, 44, pleaded not guilty in federal court last year to one count each of attempted extortion and bribery of a public official.</p>

<p>A jury returned the verdicts on both charges after six hours of deliberation.</p>
<p>Kimbrew did not take the witness stand in his defense. He could face up to 18 years in prison when he&#8217;s sentenced June 4.</p>
<p>Kimbrew &#8220;left a pretty damning trail,&#8221; Assistant U.S. Attorney Lindsey Greer Dotson told jurors.</p>
<p>He was working in the Compton field office of Rep. Janice Hahn in 2015 when he approached a marijuana shop that was operating illegally and told an employee it would be shut down if he couldn&#8217;t reach a deal with the owners, according to prosecutors.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/irs-agent-sentenced-to-2-12-years-for-20k-bribe-from-cannabis-com"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/23203229/irs-agent-sentenced-to-2-12-years-for-20k-bribe-from-cannabis-com-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">IRS Agent Sentenced to 2 1/2 Years for $20K Bribe From Cannabis Company</div></div></a></div>
<p>Kimbrew then met with the owners at Compton City Hall, where Hahn had a district office. He told them he was working with state and federal agencies, including the FBI, and for $5,000 could &#8220;make things happen&#8221; to get the proper medical marijuana permits, an indictment states.</p>
<p>Kimbrew had no authority over marijuana shops, which were illegal in the city at the time, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Kimbrew later met at City Hall with an FBI agent who was posing as the owners&#8217; business partner.</p>
<p>Jurors watched a video of Kimbrew sitting down with an undercover agent and discussing the bribe, which the agent had hidden in a restaurant menu and passed to the defendant during a second meeting, the indictment says.</p>
<p>Hahn, who is now a Los Angeles County supervisor, was not named in the indictment.</p>

<p>Visitors to Las Vegas have a new way to help keep them out of trouble, as the local airport sets up amnesty boxes for flyers to dispose their <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">weed</a> or other recreational or prescription drugs, giving new meaning to the adage &#8220;what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. &#8221;</p>
<h2>The Boxes</h2>
<p>The bright green boxes were installed February 16 at McCarran International Airport as a way for travelers to safely get rid of cannabis or other items that might not be allowed&#160;through Transportation Security Authority checkpoints. Recreational cannabis sales were legalized in the state of <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/nevada-marijuana-sales-soar-august/">Nevada</a> on July 1, 2017, but that doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s legal everywhere.</p>
<p>In October of last year, Clark County, home to Sin City, passed an ordinance outlawing possession of cannabis, marijuana, and THC on&#160; McCarran grounds.</p>
<p>&#8220;Marijuana is prohibited on airport property,&#8221; said airport spokesperson Christine Crews in an <a href="http://www.lasvegasnow.com/news/mccarran-airports-amnesty-boxes-allows-travelers-to-discard-illegal-drugs-before-flying/987564126" rel="nofollow">interview with local media</a>.&#160;&#8220;You could face a citation fine, or you could face arrest depending on what those amounts are,&#8221; she added.</p>
<p>The boxes are located just outside the airport terminal so items can be left before entering the building, no questions asked.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>The amnesty boxes, as they are called, are about the size of a large trash can and have been bolted securely to the ground. A drawer drop, similar to those on a corner mailbox, prevents anyone from reaching inside and keeps the contents safely inside until they are removed by a contractor.</p>
<h2>What Happens After A Drop-Off?</h2>
<div id="attachment_181699" style="max-width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-181699" src="https://3ncb884ou5e49t9eb3fpeur1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/airport-sets-amnesty-boxes-flyers-dispose-weed-1.jpg" alt="Airport Sets Up Amnesty Boxes For Flyers To Dispose Their Weed" width="1000" height="600"><p class="wp-caption-text"><i class="fa fa-camera"></i> Travel Weekly</p></div>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t mean a free stash for&#160;someone, however.</p>
<p>&#8220;They [the contractor] will be collecting whatever&#8217;s surrendered and disposing of it appropriately, depending on what contents are in these boxes,&#8221; Crews said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t want your pot; leave it somewhere else, that&#8217;d be fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>Crews also noted that because cannabis is still illegal under United States laws, the drop boxes will enable the airport to avoid being complicit in smuggling marijuana across state lines.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>&#8220;Being a federally regulated industry, we want to make sure we are more than compliant with their standards,&#8221; Crews said.</p>
<p>The amnesty boxes seem to be getting a positive reaction from travelers.&#160;&#8220;I think they&#8217;re great, said Michael Aldaya, a visitor from Minnesota. &#8220;This is probably where you should dispose your drugs.&#8221;</p>
<p>Aldaya hedged when asked if he had anything to leave in the boxes.&#160;&#8220;Uh&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to disclose that right now,&#8221; he joked.</p>
<p>But Shannon, in town from San Francisco, thinks the boxes might not get much use.&#160;&#8220;I feel like anyone who probably has some sort of cannabis, weed, would probably do it before they threw it away,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;d be interested to see how full that gets.&#8221;</p>
<p>In the first week of operation, the boxes have collected several vape pens and a plastic bag of pills, according to reports.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>Final Hit: Airport Sets Up Amnesty Boxes for Flyers to Dispose Their Weed</h2>
<p>So far, 13 of the amnesty boxes have been installed in high-traffic areas of the airport. Ten are located at the terminal, with three more at the car rental complex.</p>
<p>The Clark County Department of Aviation, the airport operator, has plans to install seven more of the amnesty boxes at other sites including the Henderson Executive Airport and the North Las Vegas Airport, bringing the total number to 20.</p>

Despite draconian penalties for cannabis possession and use, <a href="http://www.eurasiancommission.org/ru/act/trade/catr/nontariff/Pages/ediny_perechen_30.aspx">Russia&#8217;s laws allow the import and consumption of medical cannabis</a> not only during the world&#8217;s biggest sporting event in 2018, but at any time.</p>
<p>Patients may bring their medication in and out of Russia so long as they also carry supporting medical documents that indicate the name of the patient, total quantity they may carry and dosage amounts allowed by law in their home state or country. Official medical documents or certified copies must be translated into Russian and notarized.</p>
<p>The World Soccer Association, FIFA, even allows people to bring and use narcotic prescription drugs including cannabis for personal needs, as long as the patients carry corresponding documentation in Russian and English. But because all stadiums will be non-smoking areas, edibles or vaping would be the only legal way for spectators to medicate for spectators.</p>
<p>In 2004, the European Football Association UEFA first experimented with the<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jun/11/drugsandalcohol.football"> toleration of cannabis</a> use in stadiums simultaneously with alcohol during games at the European Soccer Championships. The 2004 Euro Soccer Cup is still considered one of the most non-violent soccer events.</p>

Local restaurants are having a near-impossible time hiring and retaining cooks, and the effects may be showing up on the plate and in the check.</p>
<p>The drum-tight unemployment rate and the frenetic pace of new restaurant openings are major factors. But as it turns out, people who are good on the kitchen prep line or in the dish room can make almost double the hourly wage trimming marijuana for sale.</p>

<hr>
<p>While there are no hard data on people leaving the restaurant industry for marijuana, many Denver chefs and restaurant owners believe pot is a major culprit for their cook conundrum.</p>
<p>&#8220;We go months trying to fill a position. It&#8217;s always been bad, but then they legalized marijuana and it got real bad. There&#8217;s no way we can pay what they&#8217;re paying,&#8221; said chef Justin Brunson, owner of the restaurants The Royal Rooster and Old Major Culture Meat and Cheese.</p>

<p>Entry-level bud trimmers make $12-15 an hour, but speedy cutters can earn upward of $20, according to cannarecruiter.com. This compares with average of $12.83 per hour paid to line and prep cooks &#8212; still above minimum wage, but considering the physical demands of kitchen work, many people choose jobs that don&#8217;t require them to perform near-constant aerobic feats in a windowless, 90-degree room.</p>

Gillman and Katie Leslie</strong>, <em> The Dallas Morning News</em></p>                                                <p>WASHINGTON &#8212; The fight between Sen. Ted Cruz and challenger <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/tag/beto-orourke/">Beto O&#8217;Rourke</a> pits a tea party darling who used his first term to run for the White House against a dynamic three-term congressman hoping to snap his party&#8217;s 25-year losing streak in Texas.</p>
<p>Both cleared the primaries on Tuesday with little resistance, and even before polls closed, Cruz was framing the race as a bid by &#8220;angry&#8221; Bernie Sanders-style liberals to attack Texas&#8217; conservative values.</p>
<p>&#8220;Congressman O&#8217;Rourke is a left-wing liberal Democrat,&#8221; said Cruz, who only recently began mentioning his rival by name, in a call with Texas reporters. &#8220;It is true that the extreme left is angry and energized and they hate the president &#8230; . But the good news is there are more conservatives than there are liberals in Texas.&#8221;</p>
<p>O&#8217;Rourke shrugged off the label and said that like voters, he&#8217;s focused on jobs, a living wage, education and affordable health care.</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you define any of that on the political spectrum?&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not running against anyone. I&#8217;m running with the people of Texas to do something really great for this country,&#8221; he said, adding: &#8220;There&#8217;s really not much I need to say about Senator Cruz. I trust the people of Texas. I trust their ability to make their own judgments.&#8221;</p>
<p>Texas Republicans haven&#8217;t lost statewide since 1994. But President Donald Trump looms over the midterm elections, and even in Texas, some voters will use their ballots to signal dismay with him and punish his most ardent defenders, among them Cruz.</p>

<hr>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a slam dunk,&#8221; said Jennifer Duffy, who tracks Senate races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. &#8220;Yeah it&#8217;s Texas, but the environment is bad even in Texas,&#8221; she said, adding that Trump &#8220;is going to be the third candidate on the ballot in a way that is very real &#8230; . Cruz might have to work for this one.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cook ranks the race &#8220;likely Republican.&#8221; So does CNN, a recent downgrade from &#8220;Solid Republican.&#8221;</p>
<p>Republicans hold a 51-49 majority in the Senate. Of the 26 seats Democrats are defending, 10 are in states that Trump won. Trump won Texas, though by a smaller margin than recent GOP nominees.</p>
<p>The last Democrat to represent Texas in the Senate was Bob Krueger, an appointee who kept the seat warm for five months in 1993 after Democrat Lloyd Bentsen resigned to serve as Bill Clinton&#8217;s Treasury secretary. Kay Bailey Hutchison ousted Krueger in a special election. Cruz took over when she retired in 2012, after an upset win over then-Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst in the primary.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is inconceivable to me that Senator Cruz loses in the fall,&#8221; said GOP strategist Rob Jesmer, former executive director of the party&#8217;s Senate campaign arm, the National Republican Senatorial Committee. &#8220;That being said, I think we are heading into a very challenging environment in the fall and that could result in a more competitive race than Texas Republicans are used to.&#8221;</p>
<p>On issues, the choice for voters is stark.</p>
<p>Cruz is among the most conservative members of the Senate and his take-no-prisoners style during his first term made him a major irritant both to Barack Obama and to GOP leaders.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Rourke has positioned himself as more of a moderate, though support for legalizing marijuana &#8212; not that he emphasizes that issue &#8212; is one of many stances that open him to attack.</p>
<p>They largely agree on support for free trade and NAFTA. But they diverge on Obamacare, immigration policy, border security and taxes. Cruz touts a top grade from the NRA and tweaked O&#8217;Rourke for earning an F over his support for restrictions on high capacity magazines and assault-style weapons.</p>
<p>Where O&#8217;Rourke accuses Cruz and Trump of a heartless approach to immigration and a foolish call for a border wall that would mainly antagonize a key trading partner, Cruz hits back that the Democrat supports open borders and amnesty for undocumented immigrants.</p>
<p>&#8220;I am not remotely afraid to debate left-wing liberal socialists,&#8221; Cruz said in committing to debate his rival, noting that he faced off three times with Sanders on CNN over the past year, &#8220;and the values of Texas are not the values of Congressman O&#8217;Rourke or Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren or Chuck Schumer.&#8221;</p>
<p>O&#8217;Rourke, too, said he looked forward to debating his rival in coming months.</p>

<p>He contrasted his support for universal health care with Cruz instigating a 16-day government shutdown in 2013 in a bid to defund the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>He also noted that while they both won their seats in 2012, Cruz was angling for the White House almost immediately.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ted Cruz leaves Texas and is campaigning in Iowa and is in New Hampshire, and he boasts of having visited every one of the 99 counties of Iowa,&#8221; O&#8217;Rourke said.</p>
<p>In the primaries, Cruz faced Houston energy lawyer Stefano de Stefano, Christian TV producer Bruce Jacobson Jr., accountant and self-described moderate Mary Miller, and former La Marque mayor Geraldine Sam.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Rourke faced Sema Hernandez, who described herself as a &#8220;progressive Berniecrat,&#8221; and retired postal worker Edward Kimbrough.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Rourke has raised more than $8.7 million since declaring his candidacy last March, topping Cruz in that same period. In the first six weeks of 2018 alone, he outraised Cruz $2.3 million to $800,000 &#8212; a wake-up call for Republicans who had assumed that Texas would remain a dependable fortress.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Rourke did this while shunning PAC money, endearing himself to grassroots Democrats but potentially hobbling himself for the fall.</p>
<p>GOP strategist Brendan Steinhauser, who ran Sen. John Cornyn&#8217;s 2014 race, said it would take at least $10 million to &#8220;run any semblance of a statewide campaign&#8221; against Cruz, preferably $25 million. That makes shunning PAC money a good talking point but a &#8220;big mistake.&#8221;</p>
<p>Still, Cruz enters the general campaign with a $6 million war chest, an edge of more than $1 million.</p>
<p>Outside groups on the right and left could pour money into Texas if they smell opportunity. But the party committees are likely to remain on the sidelines. With roughly 20 media markets in Texas, they can get more bang for the buck elsewhere.</p>
<p>Cruz enters the race with near universal name recognition, but also a reputation as a polarizing figure.</p>
<p>He adamantly refuses to accept responsibility for the 2013 shutdown, an episode that propelled his presidential aspirations, cementing the affection of conservatives and making him a reviled adversary for the left.</p>
<p>O&#8217;Rourke, by contrast, opened this campaign unknown beyond his El Paso base, far from the vote-rich regions around Dallas and Houston.</p>
<p>He has barnstormed Texas for months, drawing surprisingly large crowds in small and medium-sized cities that statewide Democratic candidates have neglected for years &#8212; though retail scale politics has limits in a state so vast.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is as simple and direct as democracy can get,&#8221; he said, adding that he plans to continue that approach.</p>

<hr>
<p>&#8220;O&#8217;Rourke has surpassed every expectation&#8221; in terms of attracting funds and attention, Duffy said.</p>
<p>But even if O&#8217;Rourke &#8220;looks like a Kennedy&#8221; and makes voters swoon with support for term limits and &#8220;doesn&#8217;t sound like a prepackaged candidate,&#8221; said Steinhauser, his chances hinge on &#8220;huge turnout&#8221; among Democrats.</p>
<p>Republicans profess little concern for Cruz&#8217;s prospects. But what they refer to euphemistically as a tough environment, Democrats call the &#8220;Trump factor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Cruz has tied himself unabashedly to the divisive president and said Tuesday night that he welcomes Trump&#8217;s support.</p>
<p>Gilberto Hinojosa, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, said that even voters who don&#8217;t usually support Democrats &#8220;are sick and tired of the way the Republican Party is turning a blind eye to (Trump&#8217;s) incompetence, the corruption, and his playing footsie with the Russians.&#8221;</p>
<p>And the Cruz-Trump alliance is hardly the only line of attack Democrats will pursue.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got plenty of ammunition to use against him,&#8221; he said.</p>

(AP) &#8212; Supporters of legalizing medical marijuana in Kentucky made their case to a legislative panel Monday, touting it as a safe alternative to highly addictive opioid painkillers.</p>
<p>The bill heard by the House Judiciary Committee would strictly regulate the introduction of medical cannabis, and would leave it up to cities or counties whether to allow it. The panel took no vote on the measure, and its chairman said the bill would come up again later.</p>
<p>Showing their <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/15/kentucky-medical-marijuana-bill-2018/96782/">pent-up demand for action</a>, proponents packed the hearing and cheered when medical marijuana was touted as a viable option to help with chronic pain or certain diseases.</p>
<p>&#8220;House Bill 166 is not about a party,&#8221; said Jaime Montalvo, president of the group Kentuckians for Medicinal Marijuana. &#8220;It&#8217;s not about having fun. This is about sick patients, qualifying patients, having safe access to a plant created by our Creator.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bill resulted from work by a task force led by Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in 2014.</p>
<p>State Rep. John Sims Jr., the bill&#8217;s lead sponsor, said legalizing medical cannabis would help combat Kentucky&#8217;s deadly addiction woes from opioid painkillers. Supporters cited studies showing a sharp drop in opioid prescriptions in states where medical marijuana is allowed. Twenty-nine states have legalized it, they said.</p>
<p>Kentucky&#8217;s lack of a medical marijuana law has created a &#8220;medical refugee crisis,&#8221; said Sims, a Democrat from Flemingsburg. Kentuckians have uprooted their lives to seek the treatment for themselves or loved ones in states where medical cannabis is legal, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is about patients who have exhausted all their options and resources and now are begging us to pull our heads from the sand to help,&#8221; Sims told the committee.</p>

<p>The testimony Monday was limited to the bill&#8217;s supporters. Sims said he expected opponents to make their case at the next hearing.</p>
<p>Asked about the bill&#8217;s prospects, Sims told reporters: &#8220;We&#8217;re close on the votes.&#8221;</p>
<p>More than 20 House members from both parties have signed on as co-sponsors. The bill would strictly regulate and license use of medical cannabis in Kentucky, and those seeking access would have to clear multiple steps, including approval from a new state enforcement agency. </p>
<p>Potential patients would have to show they have qualifying conditions, such as cancer, chronic pain, multiple sclerosis and post-traumatic stress disorder. If approved, they would be given a special ID and would have to go to state-approved dispensaries to purchase the medical marijuana.</p>
<p>Each step of the process would be licensed &#8212; from those growing cannabis, to the processors, distributors and dispensaries. An excise tax would be imposed at the wholesale level.</p>
<p>Participation would be optional for local communities. City and county governing bodies would decide whether to allow local medical cannabis licensing. If elected officials refused to act, local residents eventually could mount efforts to put the issue on the local ballot.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do the right thing,&#8221; Democratic state Rep. Al Gentry told the committee. &#8220;Give the people what they want, and allow certain suffering Kentuckians access to a product that is known to be safer and more effective for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>The legislation is House Bill 166.</p>

<p>For a second straight day, the House Judiciary Committee heard testimony but took no vote on the measure. Committee Chairman </p>
<p>Joe Fischer said it could come up again Wednesday.</p>
<p>A day after <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/03/05/kentucky-medical-marijuana-legislative-hearing/100687/">hearing from medical marijuana supporters</a>, the panel took comments from law enforcement officials and a Warren County prosecutor. They warned that legalization could exacerbate Kentucky&#8217;s drug addiction woes.</p>

<hr>
<p>&#8220;This is a road we do not want to go down,&#8221; said Chris Cohron, representing the Kentucky Commonwealth&#8217;s Attorneys Association.</p>
<p>Legalizing medical cannabis would send the wrong message, creating &#8220;a dangerous illusion&#8221; that marijuana is safe, Daviess County Sheriff Keith Cain said. That would be &#8220;a sure prescription for increased use,&#8221; especially among young people, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;My opposition to this legislation isn&#8217;t because I lack compassion for the sick, but because I think it&#8217;s wrong to herald marijuana &#8212; with its many proven negative qualities,&#8221; the sheriff said.</p>
<p>Opponents also included groups representing police chiefs and narcotics officers.</p>
<p>Tommy Loving, representing the Kentucky Narcotic Officers&#8217; Association, pointed to a section of the bill that would allow each medical marijuana patient to possess up to 12 mature cannabis plants. That would equal about 12 pounds of harvested marijuana, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;I just can&#8217;t imagine what disability you&#8217;d need 12 pounds of marijuana,&#8221; he said.<br>
A day earlier, medical marijuana supporters said the bill would strictly regulate medical cannabis and leave it up to cities or counties whether to allow it.</p>

<p>The bill would license use of medical cannabis. Those seeking access would have to clear multiple steps, including approval from a new state enforcement agency. Potential patients would have to show they have qualifying conditions, such as cancer, chronic pain, multiple sclerosis and post-traumatic stress disorder. If approved, they would be given a special ID and would have to go to state-approved dispensaries to buy medical marijuana products.</p>
<p>Each step of the process would be licensed &#8212; from those growing cannabis, to the processors, distributors and dispensaries. An excise tax would be imposed at the wholesale level.</p>
<p>Participation would be optional for local communities. City and county governing bodies would decide whether to allow local medical cannabis licensing. If elected officials refused to act, local residents eventually could mount efforts to put the issue on the local ballot.</p>
<p>Some committee members started staking out their positions on the bill Tuesday.</p>
<p>Rep. Jason Nemes said he ran for office as a medical marijuana opponent, but said his position evolved after listening to advocates. He&#8217;s now a legalization supporter, he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Who the heck do we think we are as a government to keep this away from people if it helps them,&#8221; the Louisville Republican said.</p>
<p>But he added that he couldn&#8217;t vote for the bill in its current form.</p>
<p>After the hearing, <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/15/kentucky-medical-marijuana-bill-2018/96782/">medical marijuana advocate Eric Crawford said he wouldn&#8217;t give up the fight</a>, regardless of what happens to this year&#8217;s bill.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming here whether the bill passes or not. I&#8217;ll be here next year &#8230; trying to get it passed again,&#8221; the Mason County man said.</p>
<p>The legislation is House Bill 166.</p>

<p>JUNEAU, Alaska (<em>AP</em>) &#8212; Taking a cue from the fight over immigration, some states that have legalized marijuana are considering providing so-called sanctuary status for licensed pot businesses, hoping to protect the fledgling industry from a shift in federal enforcement policy.</p>
<p>Just hours after U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on Jan. 4 that federal prosecutors would be free to crack down on marijuana operations as they see fit, Jesse Arreguin, the mayor in Berkeley, California, summoned city councilman Ben Bartlett to his office with a novel idea.</p>
<p>Berkeley was already the first city in the nation to formally declare itself a sanctuary city on immigration, barring city officials from cooperating with federal authorities. Why not do the same thing with marijuana? Last month, it did.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew we had to do something,&#8221; Bartlett said. &#8220;This is a new engine of a healthy economy.&#8221;</p>
<p>Others may soon follow Berkeley&#8217;s lead: Alaska, California and Massachusetts lawmakers are among those with similar bills pending, though the chances for passage is unclear.</p>
<p>Alaska state Rep. Adam Wool, who owns a movie, restaurant and concert venue with a liquor license in Fairbanks, said he introduced his bill as both a statement and a precaution.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the federal government wants to prosecute someone for breaking federal law, I guess they have every right to do that,&#8221; said Wool, a Democrat from one of Alaska&#8217;s major marijuana-growing areas. &#8220;I&#8217;m just saying, we will have no obligation to assist them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Sessions&#8217; announcement invalidated a 2013 policy that allowed for legalized marijuana to flourish by limiting federal enforcement of the drug, as long as states prevented it from getting to places it was outlawed and kept it from gangs and children. His action also unsettled the industry and spooked potential marijuana industry investors. Marijuana is still illegal under federal law.</p>
<p>Casey O&#8217;Neill remembers helicopter enforcement raids of grow sites in California when he was growing up in the 1980s. It was then that his parents, carpenters who grew small amounts of cannabis, became school teachers, he said.</p>
<p>He now helps run a farm that produces vegetables and marijuana for medical use near Laytonville, California, and is glad lawmakers are looking at ways to push back against the federal government.</p>
<p>Over the years, enforcement &#8220;has been uneven, we&#8217;ll say, and that&#8217;s kind of one of the things about it. It just means that everybody&#8217;s always afraid, and that&#8217;s hard,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Dale Gieringer, director of California NORML, a marijuana advocacy group, said California has a lousy history with the federal government on marijuana enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the feds care too much about marijuana in Alaska, to tell you the truth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But marijuana has been a big industry in this state, so we&#8217;re sort of on the front lines.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no apparent panic in the industry over Sessions&#8217; change in policy, given limited federal resources and prosecutors having had discretion in bringing cases all along. But there isn&#8217;t complacency, either.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the federal government is going to effectively step in and wipe us out of business. I just find that hard to believe at this point. But they can make it hard for us,&#8221; said Jennifer Canfield, who co-owns a state-licensed marijuana cultivation operation and retail store in Alaska&#8217;s capital city, Juneau.</p>
<p>Peter Mlynarik, a police chief in Soldotna, Alaska, called the Alaska bill a terrible idea. He asked what would happen if a local agency were helping the federal government on a heroin bust but also found marijuana in the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s crazy to put that burden on, especially, police officers that are supposed to obey federal laws,&#8221; said Mlynarik, who resigned from Alaska&#8217;s marijuana regulatory board after Sessions&#8217; actions in January, saying it stripped the underpinning for the state&#8217;s legal marijuana industry.</p>
<p>Morgan Fox, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, said he can&#8217;t see federal agents raiding businesses that are complying with state law.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t put it past them,&#8221; he said, adding that new U.S. attorneys have been appointed by President Donald Trump in many states. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t put it past at least a few of them to want to gain points with their boss. But I think, politically, it would be a disaster for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Massachusetts&#8217; sanctuary-style bill was prompted by comments from that state&#8217;s U.S. attorney, Andrew Lelling, who declined to rule out prosecuting commercial marijuana businesses that are legal under state law. He later said his priority would be prosecuting opioid crimes, not marijuana.</p>
<p>U.S. Department of Justice spokeswoman Lauren Ehrsam declined comment on the pending bills.</p>

This was my first Smokers Club experience, and it was a doozy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, the soul-shattering bass of <a href="https://www.marijuana.com/news/2016/05/hightunes-perfect-weed-pairings-for-chance-the-rapper-radiohead-and-ricky-hil-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ricky Hil&#8217;s </a></span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">SYLDD</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> set the stage, followed by my introduction to Mississippi&#8217;s underappreciated treasure of an artist, Big K.R.I.T. Next came one of the more memorable live sets of my entire life, seeing a broken-legged Curren$y perform from a couch that was carried around by his stagehands. The set was quite inspirational as the dense smoke in the air was making me yearn for a similar piece of furniture to nab a quick siesta. The night closed out with a set from Wu-Tang Clansman Method Man, who somehow parted the clouds of kush in the air as he walked on the hands of the crowd as if he was the marijuana messiah.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had been to concerts and seen people smoking weed at said concerts before &#8212; and maybe had even partaken. But I had never been to a concert curated by and for the everyday weed smoker, where cannabis culture was not only embraced but celebrated. It was special and magical and made me oh-so-hungry after, which was fine because New Haven pizza is world-renowned and coming up with reasons to buy slices is part of a very unique set of skills I possess.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fast forward to 2018, and weed culture has come quite a long way since 2011 &#8212; like, it&#8217;s actually legalized in many places.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, some of the biggest concerts and festivals in the country still take a prohibitionist stance on cannabis, even when they profit directly from the culture by booking artists that make weed-friendly music and subsequently attract cannabis smokers to buy tickets.</span></p>
<h2 style="text-align: center"><a href="https://www.marijuana.com/news/2018/01/coachella-really-doesnt-want-you-bringing-weed-into-the-festival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Read: Coachella Doesn&#8217;t Want You Bringing Weed Into the Festival</a></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Coachella, the biggest culprit of them all, came out this year and reaffirmed their restrictive rules on marijuana at the festival. Arguably the most recognized mega-festival on Earth, Coachella is held in California, where cannabis culture is well established and the plant is now legal for adult-use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Smokers Club has remained true to its roots all these years, and like the plant it champions, keeps growing and growing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, this year Smokers Club is going through its biggest transformation ever, transitioning from a tour of medium-sized venues to a full-blown two-day festival held in weed-rap mecca <a href="https://weedmaps.com/earth/us/ca/long-beach/90813" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Long Beach</a>, California.&#160;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The two-day smoke-out boasts an insane lineup sure to please fans young and slightly less young, featuring the reclusive Kid Cudi, Schoolboy Q, and Wiz Khalifa performing his classic project <em>Kush &amp; Orange Juice</em> in its entirety. The inaugural Smokers Club Festival also features buzzing newcomers like Trippie Redd, Lil Skies, Dave East, and Isaiah Rashad. Seasoned veterans of the Smokers Club tour like </span><a href="https://www.marijuana.com/news/2017/09/flying-high-with-curreny-on-the-pilot-talk-trilogy-tour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Curren$y</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, The Underachievers, and Juicy J are returning for the festival, going down April 28-29, as is Smokers Club co-founder </span><a href="https://www.marijuana.com/news/2016/06/an-exclusive-interview-with-smoke-dza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Smoke DZA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_82299" style="max-width: 712px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-82299 size-large" src="https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SMOKE-DZA-3PIECE-1024x683.jpg" alt="rolling-blunt-rapper" width="702" height="468" srcset="https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SMOKE-DZA-3PIECE-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SMOKE-DZA-3PIECE-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SMOKE-DZA-3PIECE-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SMOKE-DZA-3PIECE.jpg 1200w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/SMOKE-DZA-3PIECE-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px"><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Photo courtesy of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jake_kirby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jake Kirby</a></em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Smoke DZA and fellow founder Jonnyshipes have been cultivating this club since it was a seedling of a tour way back in 2010, working their way through the growing pains to see their idea harvested into the massive success this festival seems like it will be (it&#8217;s just about sold out).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Marijuana.com sat down with Shipes, the owner of New York-based label Cinematic Music Group, and DZA, a Harlem-raised rapper with an extensive resume, to gain some insight into the decision to expand and their thoughts on weed culture at concerts, among other things. Spoiler alert: we also smoked a bunch of weed.</span></p>
<hr>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Marijuana.com:</strong> DZA, what&#8217;s it like hitting that Smokers Club stage?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Smoke DZA:</strong> As one of the founders of Smokers Club, it&#8217;s a different feeling when I hit that stage. I&#8217;m way more invested. This is our Coachella, our Bonnaroo, something for our culture. It&#8217;s unique and needed, a lot of people try to duplicate it but it doesn&#8217;t get better than the original.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>MJ:</strong> How special will it be this year to have legends like Kid Cudi and Wiz Khalifa on the bill?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>DZA:</strong> It&#8217;s fucking surreal. Even [Schoolboy] Q and Spitta, and 2 Chainz, there&#8217;s a lot of great people there this year. I&#8217;m interested to watch the show both days, even when I&#8217;m not performing. I&#8217;m just going to be a fan because there&#8217;s a lot of people I want to see, even though I was bitching about the flyer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Jonnyshipes:</strong> The flyer is my fault!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>DZA:</strong> [Laughs] They have to put some respect on my name, man. My shit is mad small on there. All due respect to the other guys on the bill, but who the fuck are these other guys and why is my name so microscopic?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>MJ:</strong> That did catch my eye.</span></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-82301" src="https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/tscf18_poster_v1-745x1024.jpg" alt="festival-lineup" width="702" height="965" srcset="https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/tscf18_poster_v1-745x1024.jpg 745w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/tscf18_poster_v1-218x300.jpg 218w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/tscf18_poster_v1-768x1056.jpg 768w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/tscf18_poster_v1.jpg 1250w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/tscf18_poster_v1-218x300@2x.jpg 436w" sizes="(max-width: 702px) 100vw, 702px"></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> DZA called me about it and I didn&#8217;t even realize what was going on yet, but I would be heated, too. I don&#8217;t want to blame others because I&#8217;m in business with them, but they basically took the artwork and put it out a day and a half before we knew about it. It was just upsetting because DZA&#8217;s name was higher on the version we were going to put out. They just jumped the gun, which was a little whack.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>MJ:</strong> Was the tour always building toward this or what prompted the change to a festival format?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> As DZA, Spitta, and KRIT were starting to pop and people kept asking about a tour, underground rap wasn&#8217;t really traveling like that. You had to be a Jay or Dre or somebody huge to get a good tour going. We were very ahead of the curve, and for the first few years of the tour, it was very different than anything anyone had experienced before. Now that Soundcloud and other streaming sites have helped bring a lot more underground rap to the forefront, you have a million of these hip-hop tours. It&#8217;s the dominant genre in music right now, and in any given month, there&#8217;s four, five, six rap tours going in and out of every city. For us, it felt like it was time to look for something bigger. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I went to Coachella two years ago with Joey [Bada$$], it was the first time I was experiencing festival culture at that magnitude. It just hit me that we have this great brand in Smokers Club and maybe we&#8217;ve been doing it wrong the past couple of years. Last year, we took a step back and didn&#8217;t do the tour. We just wanted to figure out what the Smokers Club is really going to be.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>MJ:</strong> How big of a role does marijuana play in concert and festival culture, and is it disheartening when big-name properties like Coachella turn their back on weed?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> You can&#8217;t smoke weed at Coachella? That&#8217;s crazy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>DZA:</strong> That&#8217;s fucked up, it takes away from the experience. For us, the stoners, and all those with hippie tendencies, the weed is a huge part of the music and the experience overall. It would be blasphemous for us to try to tell people not to smoke at Smokers Club.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> Certain people sniff cocaine or take molly to go experience their music at an EDM festival, so why would anyone care about marijuana?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>DZA:</strong> That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re cooler, just come to our shit. The weed will be flowing and the blunts will be burning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> Wait until we make the announcement of all announcements.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>MJ:</strong> C&#8217;mon, let us get the scoop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> What I can tell you is that we&#8217;re going to shoot a film called &#8220;The Smokers Club&#8221; at the Smokers Club Festival and it&#8217;ll be a mockumentary, kind of like a &#8220;Spinal Tap.&#8221; Wiz will be in it, Cam&#8217;Ron will be in it, Dom Kennedy will be in it, Mac [Miller] is going to be in it. It&#8217;ll be hysterical, just about how frazzled Smokers Club was in the beginning. In the early days, I was damn near a janky promoter, we just rented a van&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>DZA:</strong> No, we had a tour bus. But it was wild, we were missing shows and shit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>MJ:</strong> Why were you guys missing shows?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> [Laughs] We just didn&#8217;t know what we were doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>DZA:</strong> We were in Philly or something and had to go to Canada next and Shipes overslept. We were blowing up your phone.</span></p>
<div id="attachment_82305" style="max-width: 1010px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-82305 size-full" src="https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_2227.jpg" alt="interview-rapper" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_2227.jpg 1000w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_2227-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_2227-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.marijuana.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/IMG_2227-300x200@2x.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px"><p class="wp-caption-text"><em>Photo courtesy of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jake_kirby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jake Kirby</a></em></p></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> It was me that made us miss the show?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>DZA:</strong> Yes, it was you! I kept calling you. I had something else booked in Vancouver besides the show so I was extra mad because you made me miss both. Then once you were finally ready to go, we got stuck at the border. We always get jammed at the border, but if we had left on time, we had the border calculated into our schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> I have to fact check this story.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>DZA:</strong> Nah, this is all facts. I will say those first few years were Maniacville because we were all together with a bunch of fire weed. This guy isn&#8217;t just Jonny Shipes, he&#8217;s a part of the fuckery, too. You would think the artists are the ones going wild on tour but it&#8217;s him. That&#8217;s what makes Smokers Club so much fun. He used to dress up in bunny costumes and come dance on stage during my set.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> I dressed up as Kenny Powers one time, too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>DZA:</strong> We have a lot of fun, which is what made Smokers Club something that artists love being a part of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> That&#8217;s what made us different.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>MJ:</strong> So, now it&#8217;s fun and makes money?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><strong>JS:</strong> The best of both worlds. This festival is a statement. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Kush &amp; OJ</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> is one of my favorite albums of all time and I know stoners worldwide would agree with me, so that will be a moment with Wiz. I don&#8217;t want to do anything average.</span></p>

<p>Pennsylvania medical <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a> dispensaries already have shortages, just over two weeks after the beginning of the state&#8217;s medical marijuana program.</p>
<p><a href="https://hightimes.com/news/pennsylvania-start-medical-marijuana-sales-week/">Pennsylvania&#8217;s medicinal cannabis program</a> launched on February 16. But so far only one distributor, Cresco Yeltrah, has actually started shipping medicine. The remaining wholesalers should start coming online by the end of the month.</p>
<h2>Empty Shelves</h2>
<p>The shelves are bare at the two dispensaries in the Philadelphia area.&#160;Chris Visco co-owns the TerraVida Holistic Center in Sellersville. He <a href="http://triblive.com/state/pennsylvania/13382382-74/pennsylvanias-medical-marijuana-program-hobbled-by-lack-of-products-to-sell" rel="nofollow">told&#160;local media</a> that his shop is selling product almost as fast as they can get it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have no inventory. We took a shipment on Wednesday. On Thursday, we had the biggest sales day we&#8217;ve ever had. By this morning, all we had left were a handful of disposable vape pens,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Visco added that the preliminary results are beyond his wildest expectations.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>&#8220;Pennsylvania&#8217;s market is much larger than anybody anticipated,&#8221; Visco said. &#8220;No one could have projected it. I had projected 60 people initially for the entire month,&#8221; Visco said. &#8220;We had over 600 patients in our first eight days.&#8221;</p>
<p>Management of the Keystone Shop in Devon decided to close up shop until they receive more merchandise.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking at resuming sales the third week in March,&#8221; said Skip Shuda, Keystone Shop&#8217;s chief operating officer. &#8220;It&#8217;s frustrating for us, and it&#8217;s frustrating for a lot of patients who were looking for medicine.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Limiting Sales</h2>
<p>Other shops are taking different measures to deal with the shortage. Victor Guadagnino owns Keystone Canna Remedies in Bethlehem.</p>
<p>He implemented a cap on purchases so he would be able to serve more customers. Patients can purchase only two vape cartridges each.</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>When the product runs out, the dispensary will remain open to provide patient consultations. Guadagnino expects the industry&#8217;s problems to be short-lived.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going through some growing pains,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But as other providers come online, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll see this issue again.&#8221;</p>
<h2>Low Supply Means High Prices</h2>
<p>Product shortages and high taxes on cannabis translate into higher prices for consumers. Cannabis activist Mike Whiter <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/business/cannabis/medical-marijuana-first-week-legal-pa-sales-20180226.html" rel="nofollow">told the Philadelphia Inquirer</a> that patients are paying too much.</p>
<p>&#8220;Those prices are ridiculous,&#8221; said marijuana activist Mike Whiter. &#8220;The dispensaries have a near monopoly on this medicine and it bothers the hell out of me to see what they&#8217;re charging.&#8221;</p>
<p>However, Shuda of Keystone Shop predicts that prices will stabilize soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an early market, and we have a single supplier, and we&#8217;ll need to calibrate over time,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Real estate is expensive on the Main Line and we have to make sure our expenses are covered.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

<h2>Final Hit: Pennsylvania Medical Marijuana Dispensaries Already Have Shortages</h2>
<p>Nearly 20,000 patients have registered with the state medical marijuana program. Of those, more than 5,000 have already received a doctor&#8217;s certification. The state has authorized close to 400 physicians to recommend cannabis to their patients.</p>
<p>Eventually, 51 dispensaries will serve Pennsylvania&#8217;s medical marijuana patients.&#160; The state has licensed 12 firms to cultivate and process cannabis products will serve them.</p>
<p>Therefore, April Hutcheson, a spokeswoman with the state Department of Health, suggested patients plan ahead.</p>
<p>&#8220;We encourage patients to call the dispensaries to find out if they have what they need and to set up a consultation,&#8221; she said.</p>

<blockquote><p><span style="font-weight: 400">Medical cannabis works. I&#8217;ve seen firsthand lives it has positively impacted. I&#8217;ve seen how quality of life is vastly improved when a veteran struggling with PTSD can use medical cannabis to quiet their mind and sleep. It&#8217;s time we move away from the old-school mentalities that are holding our Commonwealth back and preventing Kentuckians from getting relief. I see legalization of medical cannabis as a huge step in fighting the opioid crisis. Frankfort has to act. There are too many people &#8211; especially men and women who have served our country &#8211; who need help. I&#8217;m counting on legislators and the Governor to make medical cannabis legal in 2018.</span></p></blockquote>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kentucky&#8217;s Secretary of State is hoping to cultivate Republican support for medicinal cannabis by appealing to the conservative ideal of state&#8217;s rights, which has been referenced in bipartisan support for similar efforts in other states. Grimes said she believes that by appealing to one of the GOP&#8217;s core philosophies and focusing on medicinal cannabis as a states&#8217; rights issue, she can sway at least some of the staunch conservatives within Kentucky&#8217;s Republican Party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;If folks are really believing in states&#8217; rights, as the Republican-led administration in Washington claims to be, the Republican-led administration here in Frankfort, at all levels from the governor to each chamber in our House and Senate, then they will see this as what it is, a states&#8217; rights issue,&#8221; Grimes said in January.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">CANNABIS CULTURE &#8211; For decades, Egypt&#8217;s hands-off approach to the Bedouin drug trade has allowed Israeli visitors to get as high as they like while vacationing on the golden beaches of the Sinai peninsula. Luckily for Elyasaf, who had been caught crossing the border with marijuana on his person, that lax enforcement also allowed his brothers back in Israel to secure his speedy release from the dingy Egyptian jail cell he shared with Ablel the Eritrean refugee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sympathetic political power-brokers guided Elyasaf&#8217;s family through a web of Egyptian bureaucracy, helping them assuage the local legal authorities, without triggering a diplomatic incident that would destroy his chances for freedom. &#8220;I&#8217;m not especially proud that I made this mistake,&#8221; Elyasaf admits. &#8220;I may also be an idiot for taking that chance. Alright. I also had to pay the price for it. But I&#8217;m not ashamed of what I do.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon realizing that he would soon be permitted to return to Israel, Elyasaf&#8217;s attention turned to Ablel, and to figuring our how to help the young man who had helped him survive an Egyptian jail. &#8220;He really gave me a lot of strength. I owe this man so much,&#8221; Elyasaf said. &#8220;If I was able to relay a message from this man, then it will have been worth everything.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without anyone else to communicate with for days on end, Elyasaf&#8217;s time in the Egyptian jail gave him the opportunity to get to know his cellmate &#8211; something that may never have happened naturally in Tel Aviv, where it is rare for native Israelis interact with African asylum-seekers as equals. &#8220;He is a skilled artist,&#8221; Elyasaf recalled. &#8220;He carved massive designs into the wall there, and all kinds of slogans about freedom, he said. &#8220;There was a massive dove carved onto the entire wall, very beautiful.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ablel&#8217;s fondness for music was apparent to Elyasaf. &#8220;I taught him the words to &#8216;Imagine&#8217; by John Lennon,&#8221; Elyasaf added. &#8220;He loved those lyrics so much, he wanted to know them in Hebrew. He said that one day, he would sing it in his own language.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The miles Ablel had put between himself and his Bedouin captors relieved some of his stress, and he eventually managed to recall the phone number of his sister Adi, also living in Israel. During his final hours behind bars, Elyasaf committed her phone number to memory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"><img class="wp-image-69888 alignright" src="https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feb2013a-296x350.jpg" alt="" width="494" height="584" srcset="https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feb2013a-296x350.jpg 296w, https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feb2013a.jpg 612w, https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/feb2013a-296x350@2x.jpg 592w" sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px">&#8220;I guess I will never forget that phone number for the rest of my life. I barely remember my own mobile phone number, but I definitely won&#8217;t forget hers.&#8221; As soon as he crossed Israel&#8217;s borders, Elyasaf phoned Adi to let her know that Ablel was still alive, that he had endured horrible tortures, and that he was now in poor but stable health, just a few minutes&#8217; drive from Israeli sovereign territory.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having discharged his duty, Elyasaf soon settled back into his regular routine. But he remained troubled by Ablel&#8217;s experiences, and what they might mean for others living in Israel, especially African refugees. &#8220;Now, you hear this story, and you don&#8217;t believe it,&#8221; Elyasaf said. &#8220;It sounds unbelievable. And really, if I wasn&#8217;t there, if I didn&#8217;t meet the young man and hear it from him myself, with him there in the Egyptian jail, lying next to me, and I see that it&#8217;s true, I wouldn&#8217;t believe that something like this is possible. What kind of country do we live in? A man is kidnapped in the middle of the day from downtown Tel Aviv!&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Elyasaf is cognizant of his privileges, aware that being an Israeli Jew of European ancestry shielded him from any serious suffering, after he got caught with weed in a third-world country. But he also believes that those privileges should be extended to Ablel, as well. &#8220;Not that it matters, but the man is Israeli. He is totally Israeli, Israeli in every single way. And I think that the State of Israel must take responsibility.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Held for ransom, then forced to Pay</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the case of Ablel, the Israeli state&#8217;s obligations were clear-cut: to protect his person, prevent his removal from its territory, investigate his disappearance and secure his safe return. These obligations were not fulfilled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But some observers contend that Israeli culpability for the situation in the Sinai extends well beyond the strange singular case of Ablel. If the actual torture of the Eritreans occurred in Egyptian territory, the ransom collection most often occurred on Israeli soil. Eritreans living all over the world contributed funds in order to redeem their countrymen-and-women from captivity and torture in the Egyptian Sinai. But more often than not, the traffickers were paid by Eritreans living in Tel Aviv, who had already run the ghastly gauntlet themselves and knew from firsthand experience of the captors&#8217; cruelty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Most of the payments were being paid in Tel Aviv. The kidnappers had always agents working in Tel Aviv. A lot of people, they were paid in person. There are at least twenty-one court cases of people that were arrested for receiving money for the traffickers. Most of the time, it would have been easy to arrest many more people, but there was no interest from the police,&#8221; Eritrean-Swedish journalist Meron Estefanos told Cannabis Culture. &#8220;The twenty-one cases, it was very rare, compared to how many people were being held hostage and how much money was being paid.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On one of her many visits to Israel to interview Eritrean asylum-seekers, Estefanos approached the Israeli police herself, hoping that if she informed them of an impending ransom payment, it would spur them to action. &#8220;We knew a payment was going to happen tomorrow morning. And then you contact the police, but there was no interest&#8221; in arresting the ransom collectors, Estefanos said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sums of money that were extorted from Eritrean asylum-seekers living in Israel were vast, she explains. &#8220;When I visited Israel in 2012, there was this sign in Tigrinya in Tel Aviv, all over the streets, where it said that a hundred twenty-seven Eritreans from one region were being held hostage in Sinai. And when I visited Lewinsky Park, Eritreans from that area were collecting money,&#8221; says Estefanos. &#8220;Hundreds of Eritreans.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In that one instance alone, she notes, Eritreans in Israel collected a seven-figure sum to secure the freedom of their kidnapped compatriots. &#8220;That they were trying to raise $8.7 million. It&#8217;s in the letter of the sign that was put in the streets of Tel Aviv. It&#8217;s a lot of money! And this money was paid in person, in Tel Aviv. So this was happening on a weekly, daily basis.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><strong>Israel&#8217;s tacit acceptance of the Egyptian torture camps</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even worse than Israel&#8217;s anemic efforts to terminate the trafficking on its own end were its tolerance of the torture camps themselves, though these were mostly located within visual range of the Israeli border. &#8220;You could see the fence from some of the houses that we visited, outside the torture camps that we visited,&#8221; notes Estefanos. &#8220;Even the hostages, when they were being held hostage, they used to say that they can see the Israeli radar.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naturally, the primary responsibility for putting an end to torture camps in Egypt lies with the Egyptian government. But the country&#8217;s 1979 peace agreement with Israel forbids it from moving military forces into the peninsula without Israel&#8217;s expressed permission. If Egyptian authorities in Cairo ever asked Israel for approval to send in a force capable of shutting down the human trafficking operation, it was never given.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Egypt can be in the area only if the country is threatened. Because of the Camp David Agreement between Israel and Egypt, Sinai was decided to be kept as a demilitarized zone. So if the country is not threatened, Egypt has to ask for permission to have military in the area,&#8221; says Estefanos. &#8220;And these Bedouins knew this, and they were actually bragging that it would never happen, even in a hundred years. And they were saying, &#8216;You cannot stop us.&#8217;&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While the Egyptian army refrained from interfering in the Sinai torture-extortion racket, the Israeli Defense Forces conducted military operations in the Sinai, for its own reasons. While the torture went on, right under everyone&#8217;s noses, the Israeli army regularly entered sovereign Egyptian territory, with Cairo&#8217;s permission &#8211; sometimes to attack Muslim militants operating in the Sinai, and sometimes to prevent groups of African refugees from reaching the Israeli border. At no point did it take any action to shut down the tortures camps just outside its territorial borders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The Bedouins believed that Israel would never bomb them,&#8221; recalls Estefanos. &#8220;They would never do that.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The existence of the Sinai torture camps had long been a matter of public record &#8211; multiple mainstream media outlets have reported on the agonies inflicted there. Even by its own admission, the Israeli government had received reports of the torture camps at least as early as 2009. But even though Israel is internationally famous for conducting complex military operations to free kidnapped hostages being held thousands of kilometers away in the African interior, it allowed thousands of refugees to be mercilessly tortured for years, right in its own backyard.</span></p>
<p><strong>Eritrean refugees forced to return to the dictatorship he fled from</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still jailed in the Sinai, Ablel beseeched the prison authorities to release him into Egypt, or to send him to Israel, or at least to Ethiopia, where hundreds of thousands of Eritreans have received refuge. But they refused, and would only agree to put him on a plane back to Asmara, the capital of Eritrea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ablel had valid reasons to fear his forced repatriation. The reasons that he had left Eritrea to begin with were still valid; President Isaias Afwerki continued to rule the country with an iron fist, as he had since it first achieved independence from Ethiopia in 1993. Moreover, during his time in Israel, Ablel had participated in protests against the repressive regime that he had fled, and he worried that word of this would get back to Asmara.<img class=" wp-image-69889 alignleft" src="https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/C2-259x350.jpg" alt="" width="468" height="632" srcset="https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/C2-259x350.jpg 259w, https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/C2.jpg 694w, https://www.cannabisculture.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/C2-259x350@2x.jpg 518w" sizes="(max-width: 468px) 100vw, 468px"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;At the freedom demonstration in Israel, I was in the middle of it,&#8221; says Ablel. &#8220;So, I had a big fear about going back to Eritrea. A really big fear. But I couldn&#8217;t do anything.&#8221; He grudgingly accepted Egypt&#8217;s terms and boarded a flight back to his home country. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t want that at all. I just wanted to get out,&#8221; Ablel insists. Upon his arrival in Asmara, he was separated from the other passengers and cross-examined by Eritrean officials. &#8220;When you were in Israel, what were you doing?&#8221; they asked him. &#8220;I was working in the field and I&#8217;m young, I don&#8217;t know about anything,&#8221; Ablel responded, playing dumb. But the officials were not convinced. &#8220;You were there with the ones badmouthing their country and government, you&#8217;re from that group,&#8221; they said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed certain that he would soon face another round of abuse, this time in his home country. But because Ablel&#8217;s health had so obviously deteriorated, the government officials grilling him gave him permission to see a medical doctor right away. And once he was left alone in the doctor&#8217;s office, he immediately escaped and went underground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the next five months, Ablel laid low in the Eritrean capital of Asmara, surviving under the radar with the help of old friends. They arranged for him to receive the necessary medical attention, and secured for him forged documents. After five months, once he had fully healed, Ablel once again took his leave of Eritrea. This time, he brought one of his younger sisters along with him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today, Ablel lives in Switzerland with his new wife Luelawit, together with their young son. In 2017, the country tightened its rules regarding refugees from Eritrea, but Ablel was still able to receive full residency rights, with the help of documentation provided by Cannabis Culture. Today, he can finally live a normal life, free of the fears that plagued him for the past decade.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But for Ablel&#8217;s sister Adi and the remaining 30,000 Eritrean refugees still living in Israel, the future remains uncertain. In early 2018, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced that Eritrean refugees have until April 1 to leave the country, or be rounded up and jailed indefinitely.</span></p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8212; END &#8212;</span></p>

					<p><span style="font-weight: 400">CANNABIS CULTURE &#8211; I am often asked, &#8220;What makes cannabis medicine?&#8221; This question leads to more questions, like &#8220;What condition/s can I use cannabis for? How much cannabis do I need to use, and how often? What strain or product do I use for my condition?&#8221; </span><span id="more-69894"></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tired of shrugging my shoulders and simply responding, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; I thought it was time to undertake my own research to add to what is already out there. So, I asked 4,276 patients, &#8220;What condition/s do you use cannabis for?&#8221; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure, we have plenty of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">in vitro</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">in vivo</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and animal studies, and even some high-quality human trials, but a sample study of this size is practically unheard of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Does the study and survey answer once-and-for-all any of the big questions that people come up to us and ask? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sadly, no. We still have to say, there are no definite answers. However, our survey does uncover a few things, notably the huge number of conditions (39 were mentioned, including depression, epilepsy, chronic pain, trigeminal neuralgia, PTSD and many more) people use cannabis to help them with, and a little bit about the pharmaceuticals that people replace with cannabis. Some key findings from our survey include:</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">63% out of 4,276 use cannabis for anxiety.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">60% use cannabis for insomnia.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">43% use cannabis for depression.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">36% use cannabis for pain.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">25% use cannabis for headaches.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">35% use cannabis for general wellbeing.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Types of medication reduced or replaced thanks to using medical marijuana: painkillers (51%); antidepressants (27%); anxiolytics (10%); barbiturates (3%); anticonvulsants (2%).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">Indicas were preferred by 35% of patients. Sativas were preferred by 25%, hybrids by 16% and 5% CBD-only.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">61% of medical marijuana patients use cannabis daily.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">74% of those surveyed use less than 1g of cannabis on the days they use it.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><span style="font-weight: 400">The most commonly-mentioned names when it came to preferred strain types include OG Kush, Blue Dream, and Gorilla Glue #1 and #4, although Girl Scout Cookies, Jack Herer, Blackberry Kush, Northern Lights, Trainwreck and AC/DC were also quite popular.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, this survey is not a clinical trial, and like many studies out there at the moment on cannabis, not a lot can be concluded from it. However, what this sort of survey does do is give us a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">rough guide</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> of where to go, as well as what we can do better in future. In some ways, a survey like this one confirms some of the things that we already talk about, like the huge number of health problems cannabis could potentially used for and its potential as a replacement for opioids and &#8220;pharmaceutical cocktails&#8221; when managing long-term pain. The question of how and why cannabis works still needs an answer, but we can posit a few theories &#8230;</span></p>
<p><b>THC and Opioid Receptors</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are four main types of opioid receptor, including:</span></p>
<ol>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Delta (&#948;) DOR OP</b><b>1</b><b>(I)</b><b> &#8211; Subtypes &#948; 1 and &#948; 2 &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> responsible for analgesic, antidepressant and convulsant effects. May play a role in respiratory depression and physical dependence.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Kappa (&#954;) KOR OP</b><b>2</b><b>(I)</b><b> &#8211; Subtypes &#954; 1, &#954; 2 and &#954; 3 &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> responsible for analgesic, anticonvulsant, dissociative/hallucinatory, diuretic and sedative effects. Kappa opioid receptors also play a role in depression, miosis (constriction of the pupil), neuroprotection and stress.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Mu (&#956;) MOR OP</b><b>3</b><b>(I)</b><b> &#8211; Subtypes &#956; 1, &#956; 2 and &#956; 3 &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> responsible for analgesia and physical dependence, (mu 1); respiratory depression, miosis, euphoria, reduced GI motility and physical dependence (mu 2); and possibly vasodilation (mu 3). The delta-opioid receptors may also interact with mu-opioid receptors to induce respiratory depression.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><b>Nociceptin NOR OP</b><b>4</b><b>(I)</b><b> &#8211; Subtype ORL1 &#8211;</b><span style="font-weight: 400"> responsible for anxiety, depression, appetite and development of tolerance to &#956;-opioid receptor agonists.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Experiments on animal models have shown THC to have an effect on </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15619107"><span style="font-weight: 400">mu-opioid receptors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and possibly the </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11826143"><span style="font-weight: 400">kappa opioid receptors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, too. Cannabis could potentially help beat chronic pain, as well as cravings for opioids.</span></p>
<p><b>The Entourage Effect</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cannabis is full of various cannabinoids and terpenoids. THC, CBD, CBG, myrcene humulene, beta-caryophyllene and </span><a href="https://www.cannabisculture.com/content/2018/02/13/what-about-terpenes"><span style="font-weight: 400">much, much more besides</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. This unique mixture of phytochemicals not only gives us a clue as to the individual cannabis plant&#8217;s physiological and (if any) psychoactive effects, but also what health problems it can potentially be used for (and avoided). Moreover, the huge variety of cannabinoids and terpenoids gives cannabis a &#8220;multi-pronged&#8221; painkilling effect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not only does cannabis numb or distract the pain, but it also acts as an </span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=The+endocannabinoid+system%3A+an+emerging+key+player+in+inflammation"><span style="font-weight: 400">anti-inflammatory</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> and helps people get to sleep and eat properly. In many ways, this makes cannabis superior to opioids when it comes to chronic pain &#8211; and </span><a href="http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/can.2017.0012"><span style="font-weight: 400">many people seem to agree</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><b>The Psychological Aspect</b></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You get up every morning, and you have to take a few pills. Then you have to take some more in the afternoon, but only 1 or 2 hours before or after you eat, and then some more in the evening, again 1 or 2 hours after you eat. This can be tiring and many people really don&#8217;t enjoy having to remember all the pills they have to take and when. Add to this physical addiction and lots of unwanted side-effects like cravings, nausea, irritability, restless legs, an inability to eat or sleep properly, emotional &#8220;numbness&#8221; and more besides, and you get the reasons why opioids, benzodiazepines and other such medications can be such a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">chore</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The overall psychological effects of taking these pharmaceutical cocktails can be devastating, and it&#8217;s not unusual for the side-effects for the treatment of pain to become as bad if not worse than the pain itself. Cannabis could potentially reduce the number of pills patients have to take, with only the most important ones becoming necessary. This also reduces the chances of negative cross-reactions with other medications, although we need to test cannabis&#8217;s interactions with other drugs and medications more thoroughly before we can say that for sure! However, it does seem that cannabis could be used to reduce pill intake, which is of massive benefit to the patients physically and psychologically.</span></p>

<p>Health Canada issued a cannabis cultivation license for the 1.1 million-square-foot greenhouse operated by the joint venture of produce grower Village Farms International Inc. and medical cannabis firm Emerald Health Therapeutics Inc., the companies announced Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Growing any agricultural crop on a large scale and repeatedly delivering expected quantities and consistent quality, with full regulatory compliance, at a competitive price is an extremely challenging proposition for even the most experienced agricultural producers,&#8221; Michael DeGiglio, Village Farms&#8217; chief executive officer, said in a statement. &#8220;The goal is for the Joint Venture to set the standard in this regard in the Canadian cannabis industry and establish itself as a preferred supplier for both the short- and long-terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>The companies plan to immediately start growing cannabis in the Delta, British Columbia, greenhouse and set expectations to receive the sales license by July 1, 2018.</p>
<p>The facility that&#8217;s the size of about 19 football field is &#8220;conservatively&#8221; expected to produce 75,000 kilograms, or about 165,350 pounds, of cannabis annually.</p>
<p>And 1.1 million square feet of cannabis cultivation is just the beginning.</p>
<p>The British Columbia-based Village Farms plans to earmark another 3.7 million square feet of greenhouse space for cannabis cultivation, <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/07/27/canada-greenhouse-cannabis-cultivation-massachusetts/82609/">DeGiglio told The Cannabist last summer</a>, shortly after the joint venture was established.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;We are devoting hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars of research at our National Institutes of Health as part of the historic $13 billion opioid and serious mental illness program that the President and Congress are funding,&#8221; Azar explained. &#8220;Over $750 million just in 2019 alone is going to be dedicated towards the National Institutes of Health working in public-private partnership to try and develop the next generation of pain therapies that are not opioids.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Azar&#8217;s representation of our government&#8217;s stance on cannabis is technically true as the plant isn&#8217;t recognized for its medicinal properties at the federal level.

											    	<p>Cannabis and church: not two items that typically go together. But, in Denver, Amazing Grace Community Church and Lightshade dispensary are working to change that.</p>
<p>In December, as part of Lightshade&#8217;s corporate and local-level giving initiatives, the dispensary&#8217;s Federal Heights location partnered with neighboring Amazing Grace Community Church to give food to people in need. To do this, Lightshade supported the church&#8217;s food pantry as well as its bi-monthly meal service through financial contributions and volunteer hours. And starting in January, Lightshade agreed to fully fund the church&#8217;s food bank.</p>
<figure id="attachment_34675" style="max-width: 1920px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-34675" src="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Lightshade.jpg" alt="Lightshade: A Dispensary, a Church and an Unlikely Partnership" width="1920" height="700" srcset="https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Lightshade.jpg 1920w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Lightshade-768x280.jpg 768w, https://www.dopemagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Lightshade-770x281.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Lightshade crew serving up some food</figcaption></figure>
<p>It&#8217;s what most would consider an unlikely partnership, but one that is making a big difference in the Federal Heights community. It&#8217;s also a partnership that makes sense for both Amazing Grace Community Church and Lightshade.</p>
<p>It all started in 2011 with the creation of the Pastor&#8217;s Pantry as a way for Amazing Grace Community Church to help out local neighbors that needed food. From there, it quickly evolved into offering hot meals for free and, under its new name Dinner for a Dollar, feeds as many as 150 people each night.</p>
<p>However, its quick growth meant that it needed help, and that&#8217;s where Lightshade came in.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our friends at Lightshade found out about these programs and sent representatives to a meal. An immediate partnership was forged, and Lightshade began to donate a portion of their profits to feed the hungry of the community,&#8221; explained Pastor Kent Replogle. &#8220;But their support did not stop there. Employees of Lightshade have come to the Dinner for a Dollar to serve and meet those that show up for dinner. These are people that really care about the community and once they have witnessed the need are willing to jump in and help out.&#8221;</p>

<p>However, that didn&#8217;t mean it was always an easy partnership. At first, the church and Pastor Kent were hesitant about accepting donations from a cannabis organization. But they quickly realized that accepting help from the cannabis industry wasn&#8217;t any different from accepting donations from a bar owner or an employee selling tobacco products. So, in the end, any concern was mitigated, especially after meeting and working with Lightshade.</p>
<p>&#8220;The donations from Lightshade are coming from a place of care and concern for those that are in need, and we have never been asked to publicize their donation from the pulpit of the church,&#8221; Pastor Kent said. &#8220;Lightshade filled a huge gap in our ability to serve those that are hungry. It takes over a thousand pounds of food a day to fill the hunger needs of this community, and the ability to get a sustainable food source is always a challenge. Through the gifts from Lightshade, we are coming closer to meeting those needs.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;Taking care of our communities is very much a part of the cannabis culture.&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p>As for Lightshade, working with Amazing Grace Community Church was a natural fit. They found the church through their partnership with <a href="http://kindcolorado.org/about-us/our-story/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener noreferrer">kindColorado</a>, an organization that connects communities and cannabis businesses to give back. Lightshade&#8217;s goal was to partner with a non-profit focused on hunger relief and who was ingrained in the community.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazing Grace checked the boxes and had little to no reservations about working with a business in the cannabis industry,&#8221; said Shannon Brooks, the VP of Marketing for Lightshade. &#8220;Pastor Kent is a kind and generous man, and a sincere pleasure to work with. He has accepted us with open arms and without judgment.&#8221;</p>

<p>So far, it&#8217;s been an incredible partnership. Beyond regular donations and volunteer hours, Lightshade teamed up with Amazing Grace Community Church to serve Thanksgiving dinner to those in need. And that&#8217;s just the start of how Lightshade makes a difference in their communities.</p>
<p>Giving back is a huge part of the Lightshade culture. They were the first Colorado dispensary to institute a Cannabis Social Responsibility program that looks for local initiatives to support, and they take their responsibilities seriously.</p>
<p>Lightshade has an ongoing partnership with The Gathering Place, a daytime drop-in center in Denver service women, children, and transgender individuals who experience extreme poverty or homelessness. Each month, Lightshade volunteers to pay for, serve, and clean up lunch for their members. They also work with their career center to help match members with open job positions within the cannabis industry. They&#8217;re also a major donor for The Gathering Place&#8217;s annual fundraiser.</p>

<p>In addition, Lightshade works with Grant Street Reach, Senior Support Services, Denver Urban Gardens, and Colorado Homeless Families. For each organization, Lightshade offers their time and funds to make a difference.</p>
<p>&#8220;We feel that it is our duty to give back to the communities who have been so kind to allow us to conduct business as their neighbors,&#8221; Shannon explained. &#8220;We feel that it is important to be an integral part of the communities that we serve and to help elevate the collective good of its residents.&#160;We have skin in the game. In addition, we want to instill a spirit of giving in our employees by creating opportunities for them to engage in charitable work.&#8221;</p>
<p>So, while it might seem that a church and the cannabis industry have little in common, when it comes to helping those in need, they&#8217;re on the same page. &#8220;Taking care of our communities is very much a part of the cannabis culture,&#8221; said Shannon.</p>

<p>The Assembly Oversight Committee held the hearing in Trenton, with three additional meetings planned for the spring across the state.</p>
<p>The issue is front and center after <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/tag/phil-murphy/">Democrat Phil Murphy</a> won last year&#8217;s gubernatorial race while <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2018/01/16/phil-murphy-new-jersey-marijuana/96881/">campaigning for legalization</a>.</p>
<p>Despite Murphy&#8217;s support, some in the Democratic-led Legislature are questioning whether New Jersey should join the <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2016/10/14/legal-marijuana-laws-by-state-map-united-states/62772/">nine other states and the District of Columbia in legalization the drug</a>.</p>
<p>There was no specific bill under consideration on Monday, though legislators have introduced <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/06/26/new-jersey-legal-marijuana-christie/82392/">a measure that would legalize the recreational use of marijuana for those who are at least 21 years old</a>.</p>

<p>Advocates said legalization could <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/09/15/new-jersey-marijuana-legalization-democrats/88158/">boost state revenue and the economy</a>, help end a pot-fueled black market and reduce drug-related arrests. Opponents disputed those findings.</p>
<p>Lawmakers heard extensively from out-of-state officials, including <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/09/01/massachusetts-marijuana-board-finalized/87207/">Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commissioner Shaleen Title</a> and <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/tag/dan-pabon/">Democratic Colorado state Rep. Dan Pabon</a>.</p>
<p>Pabon said he voted against legalization in 2012, but has since changed his view, praising how his state focused on keeping marijuana away from children, criminals and drug cartels. He suggested that lawmakers begin keeping data on drug-related emergency room visits and so-called driving while drugged incidents, so New Jersey has a baseline of data if legalization moves forward.</p>
<p>Pabon said legalization comes down to getting support from a majority of people who will not use the drug but would benefit from the new tax revenues.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve gotta convince them this is a good use of taxpayers&#8217; dollars,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They just want to know where the taxes are going.&#8221;</p>

<hr>
<p>Former New Jersey State Police Superintendent Col. Rick Fuentes told lawmakers that he has concerns about legalization based on his meeting with a counterpart in Colorado, specifically citing <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/2017/08/25/colorado-traffic-fatalities-marijuana-link/86767/">higher instances of driving while under the influence of drugs</a>.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Capt. Todd Raybuck said he has seen the &#8220;harmful impact&#8221; of legalization firsthand since Nevada legalized the drug last year.</p>
<p>The hearing at times hinged on emotional testimony from both sides.</p>
<p>Rob Cressen, a former state Republican Party official, backed legalization. Cressen suffers from complex regional pain syndrome and uses medical marijuana.</p>
<p>&#8220;Simply put it&#8217;s about liberty, the liberty for adults to make our own choices on how we medicate and how we recreate. Cannabis has saved me,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Luke Niforatos, an opponent and the chief of staff and senior policy adviser for <a href="https://www.thecannabist.co/tag/smart-approaches-to-marijuana/">Smart Approaches to Marijuana</a>, which opposes legalization, said he and his wife left Colorado because of the drug. He said they were walking their 16-month-old daughter in Denver when they passed through a cloud of marijuana smoke and became concerned about her well-being.</p>
<p>&#8220;This has not been the panacea we were promised,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Medical <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">marijuana</a> is beneficial in the treatment of a number of neurological conditions, including <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/science/new-research-says-cannabis-can-treat-tourette-syndrome/">Tourette syndrome</a>. In recent years, researchers from all over the world have discovered that cannabis can calm the symptoms of this severe tic disorder. It is for this reason that the scientific minds of Australia are launching a study of medical marijuana and Tourette syndrome of their own. They believe cannabis could eventually replace the antipsychotic medications typically prescribed for these patients.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Wesley Medical Research Institute <a href="http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/medicinal-cannabis-trial-for-tourette-syndrome-patients-at-wesley/news-story/6fcf98fe66b3cd65a1ebe3b59c53281f" rel="nofollow">announced</a> a trial involving cannabis and Tourette syndrome. Neuropsychiatrist Philip Mosley will lead the study, which will consist of around 24 adult patients.</p>
<p>The goal of this limited exploration is to learn how marijuana, specifically the psychoactive and non-intoxicating compounds of the plant, can control the involuntary motor tics and verbalizations often experienced by those suffering from this affliction.</p>
<h2><strong>What Is Tourette Syndrome?</strong></h2>
<p>Tourette syndrome is a neurodevelopmental condition that develops in childhood. It is classified a tic disorder. People living with this condition experience many challenges. One of the hardest aspects of living with this disorder is that it can be difficult to maintain gainful employment and be socially active.</p>
<p>Of course, some cases are worse than others. The physical tics associated with Tourette syndrome can range from eye blinking to jaw movements.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentA -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontenta article_middleContentA dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>But for some, phonic tics, such as hooting and shouting, can cause more problems. According to <a href="https://www.tourette.org/about-tourette/overview/what-is-tourette/" rel="nofollow">Tourette Association of America</a>, 10-15 percent of the outbursts from vocal tics are obscene language.</p>
<p>This is called coprolalia. It is the most common portrayal of Tourette by the television and film industry.</p>
<h2><strong>Not Many Treatment Options for People With Tourette Syndrome</strong></h2>
<p>Tourette sufferers are traditionally prescribed antipsychotic medications. But these treatments are expensive and come with nasty side effects. The only other option is surgery. Medical experts claim that people with Tourette syndrome have had a great deal of success with this treatment.</p>
<p>But &#8220;not everyone wants to have brain surgery,&#8221; says Dr. Mosley.</p>
<p>Unlike similar studies, this one will focus on the application of <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/science/thc-tetrahydrocannabinol/">THC</a> and <a href="https://hightimes.com/health/cannabidiol-cbd/">CBD</a>. Although there has been a lot of focus recently on the medicinal value of CBD, which does not get patients high, Dr. Mosley suspects that &#8220;it&#8217;s a combination of the two [compounds] that will hit the sweet spot.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>He also believes that THC, the psychoactive component of marijuana, may be a secret weapon against this tic disorder. But the problem is that higher levels of this compound could bring on more anxiety in patients.</p>
<p>Many folks suffering from Tourette syndrome already have anxiety issues, so a more well-balanced <a href="https://hightimes.com/culture/the-ensemble-effect-not-the-entourage-effect-says-dr-grinspoon/">combination of the two cannabinoids</a> will likely work best.</p>
<h2><strong>Final Hit: Australia Launches Study of Medical Marijuana and Tourette Syndrome</strong></h2>
<p>The results of the study could show the medical community how cannabis can help people with Tourette syndrome. Dr. Mosley hopes the trial will be &#8220;beneficial for this condition,&#8221; and enable doctors to prescribe it with more confidence.</p>
<p>The study, which has been made possible through a $100,000 grant, is expected to get underway toward the middle of the year. Perhaps more studies involving medical marijuana and Tourette syndrome will follow.</p>

			<p>A North Carolina company is making the cannabis industry&#8217;s first play for consumers of color with a line of beauty products aimed at ethnic minorities.</p>
<p>The Hemp Excellence line of body lotions, lip balms and CBD capsules went on sale this month&#160;at two beauty shops that cater to women of color in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.</p>
<p>The maker of the line, Founder&#8217;s Hemp of Asheboro, North Carolina, is in talks to expand Hemp Excellence distribution to South Africa, Ghana, Bolivia and other countries.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think this could be a seven-figure brand for us within 12 to 15 months,&#8221; said Bob Crumley, controlling shareholder of Founder&#8217;s Hemp.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cannabisbenchmarks.com/annual-review-and-outlook-2017-2018-edition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-66014" src="https://mjbizdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/1.png" alt="" width="300"></a>Hemp Excellence is thought to be the first legal cannabis line of products aimed specifically at ethnic minorities in America.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a huge untapped market,&#8221; Crumley said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking for maximum market exposure in cannabis, but no one was making packaging or scents or ingredients aimed at a multicultural audience.&#8221;</p>
<p>Founder&#8217;s Hemp teamed with a marketing and distribution company known for placing products before multicultural consumers.</p>
<p>The company, Segment Marketing Services of Winston-Salem, has plans to get Hemp Excellence products in barber shops and hair salons that serve customers of color.</p>
<p>&#8220;We have deep relationships in the community,&#8221; said Segment Marketing Services CEO&#160;Lafayette Jones, a former marketing executive at Proctor &amp; Gamble and Kraft Foods.</p>
<p>&#8220;The multiethnic populations in America are growing faster than any other. So if you&#8217;re an entrepreneur, you need to know this sector.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Limited CBD offerings</strong></p>
<p>The Hemp Excellence line contains only one product that contains cannabinoids, the CBD capsules.</p>
<p>The other Hemp Excellence products are made from hemp seed oil, in part to appeal to customers who may be hesitant to try cannabinoids.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are still a lot of people under the misconception that cannabinoids have to come from marijuana,&#8221; Crumley said.</p>
<p>Other CBD producers said the market potential for personal-care products aimed at women of color is huge but that producers have been slow to market themselves as ethnic products because they don&#8217;t want to be seen as stereotyping people.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s still taboo in the Hispanic and African-American communities to be seen as embracing cannabis,&#8221; said Silvia Orizaba, founder of Sacred Mind &amp; Body.</p>
<p>The Northbrook, Illinois-based company makes personal-care products, including CBD, but doesn&#8217;t have a line aimed at women of color.</p>
<p>Orizaba told <em>Marijuana Business Daily</em> that ethnic minorities are &#8220;a little bit cautious when it comes to using products including cannabis and hemp.</p>
<p>&#8220;They feel sometimes that cannabis is only OK for white people. It&#8217;s going to take some time to penetrate that community.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hemp Excellence had no initial sales figures from the North Carolina launch.</p>
<p>But Jones said the beauty-supply stores carrying the line have seen great interest from customers.</p>
<p>Hemp Excellence plans to launch hemp-oil hair-care products soon.</p>
<p>Hemp oil can help extend the life of both synthetic and human hair extensions, though no products currently on the market are aimed at the use, Jones said.</p>
<p><strong>&#8216;Enormous opportunity&#8217;</strong></p>
<p>According to market&#160;research firm Mintel, black consumers in the United States&#160;<a href="http://www.mintel.com/press-centre/beauty-and-personal-care/black-haircare-regimens-boost-shampoo-sales-in-the-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spent more than $2.5 billion</a> on hair-care products in 2016.</p>
<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s enormous opportunity here,&#8221; Jones said.</p>
<p>Roz McCarthy, head of the Florida advocacy group Minorities For Medical Marijuana, said she expects to see other hemp and CBD companies begin marketing to minorities.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a matter of having products aimed specifically at minorities; it&#8217;s about educating minorities about the benefits of the products that are already out there,&#8221; McCarthy said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a learning gap when it comes to hemp and CBD, but I think you&#8217;ll see that change.&#8221;</p>

With U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions&#8217; rescission of the </span><a href="https://www.apnews.com/709665c7c40c441fbfd250238dadfed4" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Cole Memo</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, state industries face the concern that federal prosecutors will start enforcing cannabis regulations. The consumption, possession, cultivation, sale and distribution of cannabis is still illegal at the federal level. Just how much personal information is shared varies from state to state and even city to city.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">States collect personal information in different ways</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At your average California dispensary, residents must present their ID to prove they&#8217;re over the age of 21. Medical marijuana patients must also present their doctor&#8217;s recommendation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dispensaries will often photocopy these documents for their records or have visitors directly enter their information into a digital system &#8212; all while a security camera looks on. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This type of detailed record keeping is often required by law; the extent of which is determined by the state agencies that create the recordkeeping rules. Often, this data is intended to measure the success of a program and ensure compliance with its regulations. Most often, regulatory agencies require data be taken at the point of sale, the results of which are reported in numbers and statistics &#8212; not individual purchasing information. &#160;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Colorado law mandates that recreational dispensaries keep </span><a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2014/03/17/pot-shops-wary-of-privacy-concerns-in-handling-customer-information/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">recorded footage</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> for 40 days and allow state officials to inspect it as they please. In the event of a raid, these records could be confiscated and used as evidence. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Arkansas is another medically legal state that&#8217;s strict with its reporting requirements. Dispensaries are banned from using promotion and marketing materials and are required to treat patient information as </span><a href="http://adh-staging.ark.org/images/uploads/pdf/The_Arkansas_Medical_Marijuana_Amendment_of_2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">confidential medical records</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400">In Oregon and Alaska, however, dispensaries simply take a look at a customers&#8217; ID to confirm they&#8217;re of legal age. Customers are free to wander inside the shop without offering any personal information, though they still have the option to sign up for the store&#8217;s email list and receive promotional discounts. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">Do medical patients enjoy any federal protections?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">HIPAA protects patients&#8217; medical information </span><a href="https://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/the-truth-about-medical-marijuana-card-privacy/Content?oid=3426638" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">when they receive a medical marijuana recommendation</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">, but dispensaries and delivery services aren&#8217;t obligated to treat patient and customer information with the same discretion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tamar Todd of the </span><a href="http://www.politifact.com/california/article/2018/feb/13/how-much-privacy-do-you-have-when-you-buy-marijuan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Drug Policy Alliance</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> said the threat of a Federal crackdown on individuals is minimal. Additionally, the Rohrabacher-Farr amendment &#8212; called Rohrabacher-Blumenauer following the retirement of Senator Farr who originally co-authored the bill &#8212; prohibits the DOJ from prosecuting those who comply with state medical marijuana laws. These protections stick around so long as Congress chooses to renew the amendment every fiscal year. Thanks to bipartisan support, the amendment was reauthorized on Feb. 8.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No such federal-level policy exists to protect recreational users. It&#8217;s up to state regulatory measures to protect the average consumer&#8217;s privacy from both federal crackdowns and incursion by other interested parties. Some individual states have taken steps to protect customers&#8217; personal information. </span></p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400">How are states protecting recreational users?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In April 2017, Oregon passed a law prohibiting dispensaries from keeping or sharing customer information. Oregon lawmakers </span><a href="http://www.oregonlive.com/marijuana/index.ssf/2017/04/oregon_lawmakers_vote_to_shiel.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">passed the measure</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400"> citing fears that the Trump administration would crack down on cannabis consumers. Similar laws exist in Alaska, Colorado and Washington. Twenty five states with medical cannabis regulatory frameworks still lack such protections, some of which are also recreational states.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Marijuana policy experts are skeptical that the federal authorities would spend the time and resources to target individual cannabis customers. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;It&#8217;s very, very unlikely that there&#8217;s going to be targeting of individual customers. Many, many other targets would come first,&#8221; Todd told </span><a href="http://www.politifact.com/california/article/2018/feb/13/how-much-privacy-do-you-have-when-you-buy-marijuan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400">Politifact</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400">. </span></p>

<p>Republican Sen. Tony Potts on Monday asked the Senate Health and Welfare Committee to give HB 577 a hearing. However, Potts was quickly gaveled down while defending his motion by Sen. Lee Heider, chairman of the panel.</p>

<p>Just hours after U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced on Jan. 4 that federal prosecutors would be free to crack down on marijuana operations as they see fit, Jesse Arreguin, the mayor in Berkeley, California, summoned city councilman Ben Bartlett to his office with a novel idea.</p>
<p>Berkeley was already the first city in the nation to formally declare itself a sanctuary city on immigration, barring city officials from cooperating with federal authorities. Why not do the same thing with marijuana? Last month, <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/berkeley-declares-itself-a-sanctuary-city-for-cannabis-consumers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it did</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;We knew we had to do something,&#8221; Bartlett said. &#8220;This is a new engine of a healthy economy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Others may soon follow Berkeley&#8217;s lead: Alaska, California and Massachusetts lawmakers are among those with similar bills pending, though the chances for passage is unclear.</p>
<p>Alaska state Rep. Adam Wool, who owns a movie, restaurant and concert venue with a liquor license in Fairbanks, said he introduced his bill as both a statement and a precaution.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the federal government wants to prosecute someone for breaking federal law, I guess they have every right to do that,&#8221; said Wool, a Democrat from one of Alaska&#8217;s major marijuana-growing areas. &#8220;I&#8217;m just saying, we will have no obligation to assist them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sessions&#8217; announcement invalidated a 2013 policy that allowed for legalized marijuana to flourish by limiting federal enforcement of the drug, as long as states prevented it from getting to places it was outlawed and kept it from gangs and children. His action also unsettled the industry and spooked potential marijuana industry investors. Marijuana is still illegal under federal law.</p>
<p>Casey O&#8217;Neill remembers helicopter enforcement raids of grow sites in California when he was growing up in the 1980s. It was then that his parents, carpenters who grew small amounts of cannabis, became school teachers, he said.</p>
<p>He now <a href="https://www.leafly.com/news/industry/emerald-triangle-growers-scale-together-co-ops" target="_blank" rel="noopener">helps run a farm</a> that produces vegetables and marijuana for medical use near Laytonville, California, and is glad lawmakers are looking at ways to push back against the federal government.</p>
<p>Over the years, enforcement &#8220;has been uneven, we&#8217;ll say, and that&#8217;s kind of one of the things about it. It just means that everybody&#8217;s always afraid, and that&#8217;s hard,&#8221; he said.</p>
<div class="leafly-inline-related-story"><a class="leafly-article" href="https://www.leafly.com/news/industry/emerald-triangle-growers-scale-together-co-ops"><div class="leafly-thumb"><img class="" src="https://d3atagt0rnqk7k.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/15094156/20170529_Oneil_051-web-480x300.jpg"></div><div class=""><div class="leafly-article-callout-header">RELATED STORY</div><div class="leafly-article-callout-title">Emerald Triangle Growers Scale Up Together in Co-Ops</div></div></a></div>
<p>Dale Gieringer, director of California NORML, a marijuana advocacy group, said California has a lousy history with the federal government on marijuana enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the feds care too much about marijuana in Alaska, to tell you the truth,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But marijuana has been a big industry in this state, so we&#8217;re sort of on the front lines.&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no apparent panic in the industry over Sessions&#8217; change in policy, given limited federal resources and prosecutors having had discretion in bringing cases all along. But there isn&#8217;t complacency, either.</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the federal government is going to effectively step in and wipe us out of business. I just find that hard to believe at this point. But they can make it hard for us,&#8221; said Jennifer Canfield, who co-owns a state-licensed marijuana cultivation operation and retail store in Alaska&#8217;s capital city, Juneau.</p>

<p>Peter Mlynarik, a police chief in Soldotna, Alaska, called the Alaska bill a terrible idea. He asked what would happen if a local agency were helping the federal government on a heroin bust but also found marijuana in the house.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s crazy to put that burden on, especially, police officers that are supposed to obey federal laws,&#8221; said Mlynarik, who resigned from Alaska&#8217;s marijuana regulatory board after Sessions&#8217; actions in January, saying it stripped the underpinning for the state&#8217;s legal marijuana industry.</p>
<p>Morgan Fox, a spokesman for the Marijuana Policy Project, said he can&#8217;t see federal agents raiding businesses that are complying with state law.</p>
<p>&#8220;But you can&#8217;t put it past them,&#8221; he said, adding that new U.S. attorneys have been appointed by President Donald Trump in many states. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t put it past at least a few of them to want to gain points with their boss. But I think, politically, it would be a disaster for them.&#8221;</p>

Blood</strong></p>
<p>LOS ANGELES (<em>AP</em>) &#8212; American Indian tribes that say they have been cut out of California&#8217;s legal marijuana market have raised the possibility of going their own way by establishing pot businesses outside the state-regulated system that is less than two months old.</p>
<p>The tribes floated the idea of setting up rival farms and sales shops on reservations after concluding that rules requiring them to be licensed by the state would strip them of authority over their own lands and their right to self-governance.</p>
<p>The possibility of the tribes breaking away from the state-run system is one more challenge for California as it attempts to transform its longstanding medicinal and illegal marijuana markets into a unified, multibillion-dollar industry.</p>
<p>For tribes to participate in the state-run market, &#8220;they have to give up their rights to act as governments, with regard to cannabis,&#8221; said Mark Levitan, a tribal attorney.</p>
<p>At issue are legally thorny questions about who governs whom, taxation and the intersection of state marijuana laws with tribes that the federal government recognizes as sovereign nations within the U.S.</p>
<p>Under regulations issued last year, California would retain full control over licensing. Tribes would have to follow state rules, including &#8220;submission to all enforcement,&#8221; to obtain a license to grow or sell marijuana. Any application must include a waiver of &#8220;sovereign immunity,&#8221; a sort of legal firewall that protects tribal interests.</p>
<p>Without state licenses, businesses cannot take part in the legal state pot market. California has over 100 federally recognized tribes, the most of any state, and estimates of the number either growing and selling pot or eager to do so varies, from a handful to over 20.</p>
<p>Unlike those that have prospered from casino gambling, some are in struggling rural areas and would welcome a new source of cash to improve schools and pave roads.</p>
<p>After long-running negotiations between tribes and state officials failed to produce an agreement before broad legal sales began Jan. 1, the California Native American Cannabis Association warned state officials that tribes &#8220;may engage in commercial cannabis activities through our own inherent sovereign authority.&#8221;</p>
<p>If tribes choose to step away from California&#8217;s market, &#8220;the state will have no jurisdiction to enforce its cannabis laws and regulations on tribal lands,&#8221; the group said in a sharply worded letter to Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown&#8217;s administration in December.</p>
<p>Tribes &#8220;just want to be able to do business in the state of California and elsewhere, just like anybody else,&#8221; said Paul Chavez, former chairman of the Bishop Paiute tribe.</p>
<p>The dispute in California differs from another legal pot state, Washington, where seven tribes have marijuana compacts with the state and others are in negotiations or awaiting the governor&#8217;s approval. The compacts allow tribal marijuana businesses to participate in the legal system, such as selling tribe-grown pot to retailers off the reservation.</p>
<p>In California, the tribes are circulating a proposal that calls for the governor to strike agreements with them. Those pacts would allow them to participate in the legal market, while the state would recognize a tribe&#8217;s &#8220;exclusive authority&#8221; to regulate commercial marijuana activity on its lands.</p>
<p>Tribes are eager for a settlement, but reaching a deal in the Legislature could take the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>&#8220;Everyone agrees conceptually there should be an even playing field, a level playing field,&#8221; said state Assemblyman Rob Bonta, a Democrat at the center of the negotiations in Sacramento.</p>
<p>In addition to the problems in Sacramento, tribes are facing uncertainty at the federal level.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Attorney General Jeff Sessions lifted an Obama-era policy that kept federal authorities from cracking down on the marijuana trade in states where the drug is legal, which also guided enforcement on tribal lands.</p>
<p>The shifting ground has put a chill over development plans &#8212; including in an isolated stretch of eastern San Diego County.</p>
<p>Nevada-based GB Sciences Inc. announced last year that it would build and manage a commercial cannabis company on tribal lands, nurturing plants, manufacturing products and distributing them across the state.</p>
<p>The tribe, the Los Coyotes Band of Cahuilla and Cupeno Indians, would get an ownership stake, jobs and 40 percent of the profits. GB Sciences would get income for its marijuana research and a foothold in the largest legal pot market in the U.S.</p>
<p>But the projected $8 million project is on hold, with the status of tribes in the pot market unclear.</p>
<p>Issues involving sovereignty touch a sensitive subject for tribes, and they see the predicament with marijuana as part of a history of exploitation.</p>
<p>The state rule &#8220;harkens back to the end of the 19th century &#8230; when federal and state policies favored extermination or forced assimilation of California tribes,&#8221; the tribal group wrote.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that medicinal <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/marijuana-cannabis/">cannabis</a> legal in 29 states and recreational pot is permitted in nine states and the District of Columbia, there is still discrimination amongst its legal users, especially amongst educational institutions. Even in weed-legal states, <a href="https://hightimes.com/guides/can-colleges-ban-weed-states-legal-marijuana/">colleges can still find ways to banish the plant</a>, and in turn, punish students who might occasionally indulge in the green.</p>
<p>However, it appears one university has taken their anti-marijuana stance to a whole new level.</p>
<h2>The Rejection</h2>
<p>Texas Wesleyan University, a private school in Forth Worth, remains in hot water after an e-mail, sent by their longtime baseball coach Mike Jeffcoat, went viral earlier in the week.</p>
<p>In the letter, the coach notified a potential recruit that the school would not be accepting any prospective students from Colorado, a state synonymous with the term &#8220;recreational marijuana.&#8221; The university&#160;confirmed the e-mail on Wednesday.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thanks for the interest in our program. Unfortunately, we are not recruiting players from the state of Colorado. In the past, players have had trouble passing our drug test.</p><div class="code-block code-block-2" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">

		</div>

<p>We have made a decision to not take a chance on Student-athletes from your state. You can thank your liberal politicians. Best of Luck wherever you decide to play,&#8221;&#160;Jeffcoat wrote in the email,&#160;<a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/texas/article/texas-Wesleyan-baseball-coach-email-viral-2018-12717894.php" rel="nofollow">per the Houston Chronicle</a>.</p>
<p>The e-mail was, unsurprisingly, met with an enormous amount of backlash. The university&#8217;s vice president for marketing and communications,&#160;John Veilleux, sent a statement to the Chronicle, acknowledging&#160;the coach&#8217;s wrongdoing.</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re definitely aware of the email sent out by our baseball coach and the comments he made are in no way a reflection of Texas Wesleyan University, its values or its recruiting practices,&#8221; Veilleux said in the statement.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a personnel matter and it is currently under investigation,&#8221; he told the paper. &#8220;We follow due process here. It is our university policy to not discuss personnel matters.&#8221;</p><div class="code-block code-block-3" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentB -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentb article_middleContentB dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>The university&#160;also released a formal apology on their website, which was subsequently shared on the school&#8217;s Twitter account:</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p></p>
<h2>Final Hit:&#160;Is This Texas College Rejecting Students From Weed-Legal States?</h2>
<p>The status of Jeffcoat, who has coached the team since 2002, and is the baseball program&#8217;s all-time leader in wins with a 529-358-1 record, remains up-in-the-air.</p>
<p>The university&#160;plans to do a full investigation of the matter, but it&#8217;s clear his discriminating e-mail could result in the former major leaguer losing his job.</p>
<p>Several irate people took to Twitter, calling for the termination of Jeffcoat.</p>
<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t condone discrimination, fire your baseball coach. Otherwise, yes, yes, you do,&#8221; one Twitter user said.</p><div class="code-block code-block-4" style="margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; clear: both;">
<!-- article_middleContentC -->		<div id="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc" class="ad_pos_article_middlecontentc article_middleContentC dfp_ad_pos">
			</div>
		</div>

<p>&#8220;Actions speak louder than words. What your coach did is discrimination. I hope you are smart enough to understand you need to fire the coach. I hope the kid sues the school,&#8221; another added.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unclear what TWU plans to do with Jeffcoat at the moment, but with more and more states legalizing the plant both <a href="https://hightimes.com/news/pennsylvania-start-medical-marijuana-sales-week/">medically</a> and<a href="https://hightimes.com/news/legalization/will-new-jersey-be-next-state-legalize-marijuana/"> recreationally</a>, it&#8217;s unlikely they&#8217;ll even be able to field a team with their current coach&#8217;s ideologies.</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t that be ironic?</p>
